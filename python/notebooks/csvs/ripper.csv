He at once informed a constable, and without delay the body was conveyed on the ambulance to the mortuary.  On Wednesday afternoon, Dr. Diplock, coroner, held the inquest at the Lamb Tap, when the following evidence was adduced:- William H. Druitt said he lived at Bournemouth, and that he was a solicitor. The deceased was his brother, who was 31 last birthday. He was a barrister-at-law, and an assistant master in a school at Blackheath. He had stayed with witness at Bournemouth for a night towards the end of October. Witness heard from a friend on the 11th of December that deceased had not been heard of at his chambers for more than a week. Witness then went to London to make inquiries, and at Blackheath he found that deceased had got into serious trouble at the school, and had been dismissed. That was on the 30th of December. Witness had deceased's things searched where he resided, and found a paper addressed to him (produced).  The Coroner read the letter, which was to this effect:-""Since Friday I felt I was going to be like mother, and the best thing was for me to die."" Witness, continuing, said deceased had never made any attempt on his life before. His mother became insane in July last. He had no other relative.  Henry Winslade was the next witness. He said he lived at No. 4, Shore-street, Paxton-road, and that he was a waterman. About one o'clock on Monday he was on the river in a boat, when he saw the body floating. The tide was at half flood, running up. He brought the body ashore, and gave information to the police.-P.C. George Moulson, 216T, said he had searched the body, which was fully dressed excepting the hat and collar. He found four large stones in each pocket in the top coat; £2 10s. in gold, 7s. in silver, 2d. in bronze, two cheques on the London and Provincial Bank (one for £50 and the other for £16), a first-class season pass from Blackheath to London (Southwestern Railway), a second half return Hammersmith to Charing Cross (dated 1st December), a silver watch, gold chain with a spade guinea attached, a pair of kid gloves, and a white handkerchief. There were no papers or letters of any kind. There were no marks of injury on the body, but it was rather decomposed.  A verdict of suicide whilst in an unsound state of mind was returned."
2,index/advertiser_18890110.txt,advertiser,1889-01-10,"Advertiser (U.K.)10 January 1889It is unfortunate that there is a fundamental difference of opinion between the coroner and the jury who have been investigating what has become known as the Poplar mystery. For months past there has been a succession of abhorrent enormities forced upon public attention, and it would have been a great relief to have been assured that the death of ROSE MILLETT was due to accidental strangulation. As the matter stands additional responsibility is thrown upon the metropolitan police, who from the first have contended that the death was attributable to natural causes, and who have, in the person of DR. BOND, what the public will justly consider to be weighty authority in support of their view. MR. WYNNE BAXTER, the coroner, says ""there is no evidence to show that death was the result of violence."" In that he follows DR. BOND. The jury flatly disagree with him, and return a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown, being chiefly guided to that conclusion by the evidence of Doctors BROWNEIELD, HARRIS, HIBBERD, and M'KENNA, each of whom is of opinion that the woman was murdered by means of something of the nature of a cord drawn tightly around her neck. It is impossible for the lay reader to accurately estimate the value of the medical testimony for and against the theory of murder. In arriving at their verdict the jury were probably influenced by other than expert evidence. The woman was an unfortunate, the yard in which she was found bore an ill character, and the skilful murderer of others of her class is still at large. Much might be said in favour of their verdict and much against. It is about equally open to belief that the woman fell in a drunken stupor, and that the weight of her head against the collar of her dress compressed her larynx and caused suffocation, or that she was strangled by a cord held in a similar way to that by which soap is often cut. Either conclusion is feasible. The truth may never be known with certainty until the adage that ""murder will out"" - if murder it be - is once more justified."

If all the negro ministers can be notified this week, the special sermons will be definitely announced for next Sunday.The campaign, however, will not be confined to the church congregations.

The frightful murders in Whitechapelindicate an assassin with the cunning of a madman and the heart of a brute, andreveal a nature so foul and so dominated by animalism that we can only hope forthe sake of humanity the fiendish crimes may be traced to one irresponsible forhis actions. A London journal is accountable for the statement - which we findrather a big pill to swallow - that a police official told a representative ofthe Press quite coolly that the police would never detect such crimes as theWhitechapel murders, and that the only thing to do was to let the man-monstergo on murdering people till his homicidal mania wore off or wore him out. Thesame authority, in the most serious manner possible, expresses its regret thatthis individual only too faithfully reflects the spirit of fatalism andpessimism that is demoralising the detective department. Surely it may besafely assumed that the police authorities are doing their utmost to find theauthor of the ghastly murders, and it is a pity that they should be hamperedby the vapid nonsense indulged in by writers who seem ever ready to turn theirpen in whichever direction the tide turns. They would have been the first,doubtless, had the murderer been caught, to load the captors with fulsomeflattery.THE WHITECHAPEL TRAGEDY.The inquest on the body of Annie Chapman, 47, the victim of the latest Whitechapeltragedy, was resumed to-day at the Working Lads Institute, Whitechapel, before Mr.Wynne Baxter, the district coroner. - Inspector Chandler described the position inwhich he found Chapmans body when called in on Saturday morning, confirming thestatements of previous witnesses as to the state of the clothing, and adding thata portion of the intestines still connected with the body was lying over the leftshoulder, while some loose pieces of skin were lying near the head. After theremoval of the body he found lying near where the feet had been a piece of muslin,a tooth-comb, and a pocket-comb while near by was part of an envelope containingpills. On the flap of the envelope were embossed with the words ""Sussex Regiment""and on the front were written the letters ""M"" and ""Sp,"" the rest of the words being""London, August, 1888."" A wet leather apron was also lying near by. - Inspt. Chandlerproceeding, said there were no indications of a struggle, and none of the palingswere broken, though they bore blood stains, as did the ground in the immediatevicinity of the body, none, however, being traceable outside the yard. Most of theclothes were more or less soiled with blood. Richardson informed the police earlyon Saturday that a body was not there at five oclock, but anyone who only went tothe top of the steps might have failed to see it. The foreman of the jury askedwhether any steps had been taken to produce Ted Stanley who was said to have beenmuch in the deceaseds company, as he was a pensioner, and the envelope which wasfound bore a regimental name. It was specially desirable that he should be forthcoming.Witness replied that the police had not been able to find Stanley, and the coronerobserved that if he was well advised he would come forward. Adverting to a furtherremark from the jury as to the desirability of offering a reward, the Coroner saidhe believed the Government had given up making such offers. - Doctor Phillips,divisional police surgeon, corroborated Chandlers evidence as to the position inwhich the body lay when he was called in. He added that the face and tongue weremuch swollen, and that a portion of the small intestines and of the abdomen waslying on the ground over the right shoulder, but still attached to the body. Twoother parts of the wall of the stomach were lying in a pool of blood above the leftshoulder. There were other mutilations, evidently inflicted after death, which wereof such a nature that he preferred, if possible, not to discuss them. For cuttingthe throat and for mutilating the body, a sharp, thin, narrow blade six or eightinches long must have been used, and the manner of its employment indicatedanatomical knowledge, which was perhaps not more fully displayed in consequenceof haste. No fresh facts of importance have transpired today in connection with the Whitechapelmurder, beyond the evidence given at the inquest to-day. Mr. Phillips positiveopinion that the woman had been dead quite two hours when he first saw the body athalf-past six throws serious doubt upon the accuracy on at least two importantwitnesses, and considerably adds to the prevailing confusion. There have been nofurther arrests, but some important information respecting the two lunatics undersurveillance has been obtained."

Charles Ludwig (40), a decently dressed German of 1, The Minories was charged with being drunk and threatening Alexander Finlay, of Leman-street, Whitechapel. Prosecutor said that at three oclock that morning he was standing at a coffee stall in Whitechapel, when the accused came up drunk, and in consequence was refused to be served. He then said to the prosecutor What are you looking at? and then pulled out a knife and tried to stab witness. Ludwig followed him round the stall, and made several attempts to stab him. A constable came up and he was given into custody. Constable 221H said the prisoner was in a very excited condition, and witness had previously received information that prisoner was wanted in the city for attempting to cut a womans throat with a razor. On the way to the station, he dropped a long bladed open knife, and on him was found a razor and a long bladed pair of scissors. - Inspector Pimley, H Division, asked the magistrates to remand the prisoner, as they had not had sufficient time to make the necessary inquiries concerning him.A city constable, John Johnson, stated that early on Tuesday he was on duty in the Minories, when he heard screams of Murder proceeding from a dark court, in which there was no light. The court led to some railway arches, and was well known as a dangerous locality. On going into the court he found the prisoner with an unfortunate. The former appeared to be under the influence of drink. Witness asked what he was doing there, when he replied Nothing. The woman, who appeared to be in a very frightened and agitated condition, said, Oh, policeman, do take me out of this! The woman was so frightened that she then made no further statement. He sent the man off, and walked with the woman to the end of his beat; when she said: He frightened me very much when he pulled a big knife out, and witness said, Why didnt you tell me at the time, and she replied: I was too much frightened. He then went and looked for the prisoner, but could not find him, and therefore warned several other constables of the occurrence. Witness had been out all the morning trying to find the woman, but up to that time without success. He should know her again. He believed prisoner worked in the neighbourhood.  The magistrates thereupon remanded prisoner. The arrest has caused intense excitement in the neighbourhood. Prisoner professes not to be able to speak English. He has been in this country about three months. He accounts for his time for about three weeks, but nothing is known of his doings before that time.The adjourned inquest on the body of Annie Chapman, who was murdered in Hanbury-street, Whitechapel, on the morning of the 8th inst., was resumed on Wednesday afternoon. Eliza Cooper, a hawker, stated that she knew deceased, and last saw her alive on the Wednesday preceding the tragedy. Deceased was then wearing three brass rings on her left hand. Deceased used to associate with two men known as Stanley and Harry the hawker, but she also brought men casually to the house where she lodged. Witness could not say if any of these men were now missing. Witness had quarrelled with deceased, and they had come to blows.  Dr. Phillips, divisional surgeon, was recalled, and informed by the Coroner that all the details of the post mortem examination should be placed on the depositions.  Dr. Phillips expressed regret that the coroner should have come to this decision, as he believed that to make public the further result of the examination would thwart the ends of justice. Eventually Dr. Phillips gave evidence indicating that the object of the mutilation was to obtain one of the abdominal parts. The weapon used must have been from five to six inches long. It must also have been very sharp, and there were numerous indications that the murderer possessed anatomical knowledge. He could not have performed all the injuries, even if there had been no struggle, in less than a quarter of an hour.  Edward Stanley, bricklayers labourer, known as the Pensioner, and other witnesses having been examined, the inquest was adjourned for a week.  The jury expressed a strong opinion that a Government reward should be offered."
9,index/alderley_and_wilmslow_advertiser_18881005.txt,alderley_and_wilmslow_advertiser,1888-10-05,"Alderley and Wilmslow AdvertiserFriday, 5 October, 1888The peace of the London Sunday was disturbed this week in a manner that it has rarely been before by the news published in the papers of the morning that a few hours previously two awful murders had been committed in the East End, and within a third of a mile of each other. Following so closely on the four that had preceded them within a month, and which had already stricken the Whitechapel district with a panic, it is no wonder that a delirium of alarm and indignation should prevail. The thing is so utterly without precedent or parallel, is so, so mysterious and entirely unaccountable, the murderer  for all the probabilities points to its being the work of one hand  is so audacious and yet so cunning, the motive is impossible to understand, that it is no wonder the people should be bewildered, and that terror should reign throughout the district.The fact is no satisfactory hypothesis has been offered to account for the extraordinary tragedies. To every theory that has been started objections suggest themselves that appear to be serious if not fatal, and all the efforts that have been made to obtain a clue, much less to track the murderer, have failed. Perhaps the theory that has the least formidable objections against it is the work of a monomaniac whose fatal impulse is to make war on the wretched outcasts of the streets.What is to be done to detect the murderer and quiet the consternation that so naturally exists? That is the question of real importance at this moment. I cannot join in the violent abuse of the police, for I think it is unreasonable and unjust, but at the same time it must be admitted that the machinery under the control of Sir Chas. Warren has proved unequal to the work cast upon it. The responsibility lies with the Home Secretary under these circumstances to devise and put in operation new machinery and to try fresh methods to meet the crisis. However, I have no hesitation in saying that I think Mr. Matthews has not proved himself equal to the occasion. His refusal to offer a reward in accordance with the demand of the public of all classes, has met with severe disapproval, and been very adversely contrasted with that of the Lord Mayor. Why should not a reward be offered of such amount as would stimulate the whole population of Whitechapel to search for the murderer and turn them, especially the women, into amateur detectives? If the Government would offer a reward of say £10,000, I have a strong conviction it would have a magical effect in setting hundreds of people to discover clues to bring the truth to light. If Mr. Matthews continues obstinate  and I have reason to know that he is very obstinate  I hope in such a case the authority of the Cabinet will interpose.THE  EAST  END  MURDERS.REPORTED  CAPTURE  OF  JACK  THE  RIPPER.Telegraphing this afternoon the Central News says:- The American who was arrested last night on suspicion of being concerned in the Whitechapel murder was released at ten oclock this morning, inquiries having shown that his account of himself was entirely satisfactory. At the present moment there is no one in custody. The rumour of the actual murderer being caught has created intense excitement in London, but it is entirely unfounded.Dr. Langham this morning opened an inquiry into the death of Catherine Eddowes, who was found with her throat cut and her body fearfully mutilated in Mitre-square.IMPORTANT  SURGICAL  EVIDENCE.Dr. Gordon Brown, surgeon of the City of London police force, gave evidence as to the state in which the body was found. There was a wound in the abdomen from which a portion of the intestines had been drawn out and placed over the right shoulder. A piece of intestine about two feet long had been detached and placed between the left arm and the body. The throat was cut, the face disfigured, and the lobe of the right ear cut obliquely. When the body was undressed at the mortuary the several portions of the ear fell from the clothing. A post-mortem examination was made on Sunday afternoon. In addition to a number of slashes across the face, the throat was cut, the wound extending from the left ear to about three inches below the lobe of the right ear. The larynx was severed, and all the deep structures severed to the bone, the knife touching the cartilage of the vertebral column. The cause of death was haemorrhage from the carotid artery. Death was immediate and the other mutilations were inflicted after death. The front walls of the abdomen had been laid open, and the intestines detached to a large extent. The left kidney had been carefully taken out. From the nature of the cuts it was evident that the kidney was taken by someone who knew its position and how to take it out. The part said to have been removed in a previous case had in this been cut horizontally through, leaving a stump of three-quarters of an inch, and the rest of the part had been taken away. By Mr. Crawford: The wounds were inflicted by a sharp pointed knife at least six inches long. The person who inflicted the wounds possessed a good deal of knowledge of the position of the organs in the abdominal cavity and the way of removing the parts. The parts removed would be of no use for surgical purposes. Such a knowledge would be likely to be possessed by one used to cutting up animals. The wounds might be inflicted in five minutes. As a professional man he could assign no reason for these parts being taken away. He thought the act was that of one person only. He would not expect to find much blood on the person inflicting the wounds.  The inquiry at this point was adjourned until Thursday next at half-past ten.All persons arrested today on suspicion of being concerned in the Whitechapel murders have been released on giving satisfactory explanations, and none is now in custody. In connection with the recent crimes the surgical evidence given to-day has caused a profound sensation. It had been supposed that the murderer did not have time to do more than take his victims life, then roughly mutilate her body. It now appears he completed his horrible work with reckless deliberation and removed certain organs. The additional mutilation of the face is believed to be due to fears on the murderers part that he may have been seen in the womans company by someone, and therefore determined to make her identification as difficult as possible. The announcement of Dr. Brown of the disappearance of the uterus revived for a time the theory put forward by Mr. Wynne Baxter, the coroner in the Hanbury-street case. The British Medical Journal, however, states that the foreign physician who sought to purchase specimens was a gentleman of the highest respectability, that he did not offer a large price, and that he left London 18 months ago."
10,index/alderley_and_wilmslow_advertiser_18881012.txt,alderley_and_wilmslow_advertiser,1888-10-12,"Alderley and Wilmslow AdvertiserFriday, 12 October, 1888The Whitechapel murderer is still at large at the time of writing, and thereis a strong impression that the police will not lay their hands upon himunless the monster is caught in flagrante delicto. The man has committed histerrible crimes with almost fiendish skill, and in no single instance has theleast trace of the murderer been left on the scene. So far as is publiclyknown the police have no definite idea of the kind of man they want. Thiscold-blooded butcher of defenceless human beings may be old or young,English or foreign, respectable or depraved in appearance, sane or insane -no one has seen him, and nobody knows. There may be a cruel FRANKENSTEIN ora brutal EDWARD HYDE wandering night by night in search of victims in theparlieus of Whitechapel - who can tell? Is it surprising, then, that thepolice, so far, have failed to track down the murderer? It seems to us thatthe blame which has been placed on the authorities, from the HOME SECRETARYdownwards, has not been deserved. The murders have been made the vehicle forbitter and unscrupulous attacks on public servants, checking their energy anddamaging their efficiency. This is one of the most regrettable facts inconnection with the public calamity. The outrages were limited to oneparticular quarter, and to a class of women whose habits render it extremelydifficult for the police to afford them ordinary protection. The persons anddwellings of decent citizens have been as safe as at any other time. Thepolice of the metropolis have been increased in numbers and efficiency duringthe last two years, and London, as regards ordinary crime, compares mostfavourably with any foreign capital. Yet, because a single murderer, actingwith peculiar cunning, and with extraordinary advantages, has not been instantlycaptured, an outcry has been raised for the dismissal of the HOME SECRETARY, theresignation of SIR CHARLES WARREN, and a change in the whole system of policemanagement. So recently as Tuesday night last, an envenomed attack was made uponSIR CHARLES WARREN by Mr. ASQUITH, M.P., at Sheffield. The followers of Mr.GLADSTONE in the Press have not hesitated to denounce the failure to secure thecriminal as the natural result of the ineptitude of a Tory government, and thereader is left in doubt as to whether they or the unknown murderer deserve thegreatest punishment. All this is, perhaps, the outcome of the new method ofpolitics which has been introduced by Mr. GLADSTONE at the bidding of hisParnellite allies. To hamper and attack the constabulary in Ireland in thedischarge of their duties has become one of the recognised weapons of theGladstonian armoury. It had a certain amount of success for a time, but haslatterly become somewhat rusty and ineffective. If we are now to have it broughtinto use in England, whenever a social calamity like the Whitechapel murdersoccur, political warfare will, indeed, have reached its lowest level.A somewhat uneasy feeling, nearly allied to fear, has taken possession of manyweak-minded people in connection with the recent atrocities in the Metropolis.The idle rumour that the notorious ""Jack the Ripper"" would shortly visitManchester and continue his ghastly work is exercising a baneful influenceamong females and young persons which ought to be dispelled. The name of thenow notorious personage mingles in the daily talk of children, and, in thecountry districts especially, the presence of a strange tramp, let him beever so harmless, is a matter for the gravest suspicion, if not alarm. Thecirculation of sensational matter like that of the lives of BURKE and HARE,CHARLES PEACE, and other scoundrels of the same stamp is responsible for agood deal of the feeling which has taken possession of these people. Thenotorious ""JACK"" has had a long lease in the busy Metropolis, but anymaniacal acts committed outside London would hasten the end of his atrociouscareer.There has been no fresh murder in Whitechapel for twelve days and perhaps nostronger evidence could be given of the depth and intensity of the feeling ofalarm that prevails than the fact that there was a feeling of positive reliefat finding that the Sunday papers did not contain a report of one or moreassassinations. A re-appearance of the murderer was almost expected. Twice hashe chosen the end of the first week of the month for his operations, and it isnot unreasonable to think that his omission to do so on Saturday night was dueto the precautions which the police and the inhabitants are taking together.They left no dark corner unwatched and the number of police on patrol wasgreatly increased. The fact is, the whole population of Whitechapel are turnedinto detectives, and it is difficult to conceive how, under such circumstances,the assassin can be harboured amongst a people whose every movement, in thestreet and in their houses, is subject to the closest scrutiny.I cannot help the apprehension that now when he finds the preparations for hiscapture in Whitechapel so complete, and the attention of the authorities soconcentrated upon it, he will turn his attention to other less guarded localities,and there recommence his horrid work. There seems no reason why he should not turnto other quarters for the truth is that in many other parts of London thefacilities for such crime are as great as they are in Whitechapel. Meanwhile, Ianticipate that Sir Charles Warren will seize the opportunity of demanding morepolice. It is well known that the Chief Commissioner has long felt the necessityof increasing the police force of the metropolis, and I believe a proposal tothat effect will be made to Parliament on its reassembling, and with everyprospect of success. It is to be hoped that in that case special regard will behad to the necessity for improving the detective force - for it is not to be deniedthat in that department we are lamentably weak.WHITECHAPEL MURDERS.ADJOURNED INQUEST, THE VERDICT.The inquest on the body of Catherine Eddowes, the victim of the Mitre-squaremurder, was resumed this morning before Mr. Langham, the city coroner, at themortuary in Golden-lane. Colonel Sir James Fraser and Chief SuperintendentFoster represented the police, and Mr. Crawford, City Solicitor, watched thecase on behalf of the City authorities. There was again a great amount ofinterest taken in the proceedings, and a considerable number of personsassembled outside the mortuary. - Dr. G. W. Sequeira, of Dewry-street [sic],Aldgate, deposed that he was the first medical man to reach the body inMitre-square on the morning of the 30th ult. He entirely agreed with theevidence given on the last occasion by Dr. Gordon Brown, but supplementedit by stating in answer to Mr. Crawford, that though the body was lying inthe darkest corner of the square, the lamps would give light enough toenable the murderer to inflict the injuries. He did not regard it asprobable that the murderer had designs on any particular organ, and did notconsider that he performed the mutilations with any anatomical skill. Lifecould not have been extinct for more than a quarter of an hour when he firstsaw the corpse. The person who committed the deed need not necessarily havebeen bespotted with blood. - Dr. Sedgwick Saunders, city analyst, stated thathe made a careful examination of the deceased womans stomach, without,however, finding any trace of narcotic or other poisons. He supported theother doctors in the theory that anatomical skill was not shown by themurderer. - Annie Phillips, wife of a lamp black packer, living at 12,Dilston-park, Southwark Park-road, stated that she was the daughter of thedeceased by Thomas Conway, to whom, her mother had always told her, she wasmarried. He and her mother used to get on badly together because the latterused to drink, whereas he was a teetotaler. It was seven or eight yearssince Conway left her mother, whom she herself had not met for over twoyears. - Dr. Brown at this point took occasion to add to his previousevidence a refutation of the suggestion that the body had been conveyed toMitre-square after the murder. - Evidence was then taken showing themovements of the murdered woman on the night of the 29th. At half-pasteight P.C. Robinson saw her lying very drunk on the pavement in AldgateHigh-street, and someone in the crowd which had gathered knew her. As shewas unable to stand he took her to Bishopsgate-street station. She waswearing an apron, now identified as that subsequently picked up markedwith bloodstains near the body. Deceased was locked up till one oclock,when, as she had got sober, she was discharged on giving her name andaddress. These, she said, were Mary Ann Kelly, of 6, Fashion-street. Onleaving the station she was seen by the gaoler to turn towards Houndsditch,which would lead her in the direction of Mitre-square. Before going, however,she remarked on learning the time, that she would get a ""fine hiding"" whenshe got home. - Joseph Lewindale [sic] stated that as he and some friends wereleaving the Imperial Club, Duke-street, about half-past one, they saw a man anda woman talking together in Church Passage. He did not see the womans face, butdeceaseds clothes looked like those she was wearing. The man had on a peakedcloth cap. - Mr. Crawford, interposing, asked that unless the jury particularlywished it, the mans appearance should not be further described. - The juryagreed, and witness only added that he doubted whether he should recognise theman again. - Police-constable Alfred Lock [sic] proved the finding of theblood-stained apron in Goulston-street just before three oclock on Sundaymorning, and stated that on the wall just above the place where it wasdiscovered were written in chalk the words, ""The Jews are the men, and willnot be blamed for nothing."" He had previously passed the spot at 2:20, whenthe apron was not there. After searching the neighbourhood he reported thematter at Commercial-street. - Mr. Burrows: Was not this the sentence: ""TheJews are not the men and will be blamed for nothing?"" Witness replied thathe thought he had copied the writing verbatim, but admitted that the firstcopy was in his pocket book, which he had not got with him. He would notswear that the word ""Jews"" was not written ""Juess."" At the request of thejury, the constable went for his pocket book. During his absence,Detective-Inspector Halse, one of the city police, proved that when thewriting on the wall was reported to him he sent off an officer to makearrangements for having it photographed. Definite directions to this effectwere given, but before a photographer could arrive, the Metropolitan PoliceAuthorities, fearing that the words might lead to an outbreak against theJews, had rubbed them out. - Mr. Burrows: Did no one suggest that it wouldbe possible to rub out the word ""Jews"" only? - Witness: I suggested thatthe top line alone need be rubbed out, and the rest photographed. The wordsseemed to have been recently written in white chalk on the bricks, and were:-""The Juees (sic) are not the men that would be blamed for nothing."" - TheForeman: Why did you allow the metropolitan police to rub the writing off? -Mr. Crawford: Did you not protest against its being rubbed out? - Witness: Idid. - By the jury: The writing was like a schoolboys writing. Good roundhand. - A juror regarded it as singular that the police did not make furtherinquiries at the lodging-house in the passage of which the apron was found -Mr. Crawford replied that a most vigilant search was made as soon as thematter came to the knowledge of the city police, but that, unfortunately,the apron was found by a member of the metropolitan force, and that somedelay occurred. - Lock, on his return, adhered to his former reading of thesentence. - Mr. Crawford intimated that he could not carry the case anyfurther, and the Coroner having briefly summed up, the jury returned a verdictof ""Wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.""The Central News says the Scotland Yard authorities, having satisfied themselvesthat the man arrested at Eltham could have had nothing to do with the Whitechapelmurders, he will be set at liberty in due course. No arrests have been made to-daywithin the metropolitan district, and no persons are now in custody in connectionwith the East End atrocities. Public attention is at present absorbed with therevelations made at the inquest on the Mitre-square victim, which has caused aprofound sensation in the East End of London."

He is about 35 years of age, and has recently been living in Whitechapel. He is somewhat confused as to his whereabouts lately, and will be detained pending inquiries. The force of police in private clothes specially selected to make the house to house search in the neighbourhood of Hanbury-street, Commercial-street, Dorset-street, Goulston-street, Bucks-road [sic], Brick-lane, Osborne-street, etc., completed their labours to-day. They have distributed many thousands of handbills, leaving them in every room in the lodging houses. The greatest good feeling prevails towards the police, and noticeably in the most squalid dwellings the police had no difficulty in getting information, but not the slightest clue to the murderer has been obtained.AN  IMPORTANT  CLUE.The Press Association says:- Much importance is attached by the police to the arrest made at King-street Police-station, Whitehall. On Tuesday morning a man entered the above named station about nine oclock, and complained of having lost a black bag. While the officials were taking note of his case, he commenced talking about the Whitechapel murders, and offered to cut off the sergeants head, and other rambling nonsense. It will be remembered that several people have testified to seeing a man with a black bag in the region of the murders, and who has not since been traced. The fact was at once remembered by the police, and the man was further questioned. In answer to an enquiry as to his business, he said he studied for some years for the medical profession, but gave it up for engineering, and that he had been stopping for some nights in coffee-houses. His manner then became so strange that Dr Bond, divisional surgeon, was sent for to examine the man. The doctor subsequently gave it as his opinion that the man was a very dangerous lunatic of homicidal tendency, and, as his appearance somewhat tallied with that published of the man who was seen with the murdered woman, he was removed to Bow-street, but before being taken thither, photos of his person were taken. He was also asked to write his name, and it is stated that the writing is somewhat similar to that of the letters received by the police and others. He gave his age as 67, but it is said he looks fully 20 years younger. The police are endeavouring to trace his antecedents and movements for the past few weeks.The Times publishes the following:- Sir Charles Warren wishes to say that the marked desire evinced by the inhabitants of the Whitechapel district to aid the police in the pursuit of the author of the recent crimes has enabled him to direct that, subject to the consent of occupiers, a thorough house-to-house search should be made within a defined area. With few exceptions, the inhabitants of all classes and creeds have freely fallen in with the proposal, and have materially assisted the officers engaged in carrying it out.GHASTLY  DISCOVERY  AT  WHITEHALL.This morning, Dr Bond, in conjunction with Dr Hibberd, made an examination, at the Mortuary, Millbank-street, of the leg and foot found yesterday at Whitehall. The examination lasted for some time, but no marks which might lead to identification were discernible. The foot and leg are exquisitely moulded, and the foot has been well cared for, the nails being well trimmed, while corns or bunions, which would probably distinguish the foot of a poor woman, are absent. There is no doubt these remains belong to the trunk and arm previously found, although of course, it is impossible to fit them to the trunk, as the upper portion of the leg has not been found. All the parts which have been found are now at the mortuary. It is stated that the police are going to pump out the well at the new police buildings, and that it will be thoroughly searched for further remains.The Central News says the police were engaged from eight oclock until ten last night in thoroughly searching the ground covered by the new police offices on the Thames Embankment. The well at the works was pumped dry, and the mud and débris at the bottom was minutely examined, but no human remains were found. The police bloodhounds are also used, and whenever they showed a disposition to linger the soil was dug up with spades and minutely examined. The examination was to have been resumed to-day, but up to four oclock this afternoon nothing further had been done. It has transpired that some time ago a carman saw two men and a boy with a cart conveying a bundle stop outside the works. The boy scaled the hoarding, and opened the wicket gate, through which the men carried the bundle."

It is quite plain that the relations between the Home Secretary and the Chief Commissioner have for a long time been strained, and the relations between Scotland Yard and the Home Office anything but cordial. Sir Charles Warren, it now appears, had tendered his resignation some time since, but Mr Matthews did not accept it; the reason, I suppose, being that it would lead to an uncomfortable debate in the House, but there is no doubt that the Chief Commissioner put himself technically in the wrong in the course he adopted in this case, and so gave Mr Matthews the very opportunity he was looking for.The facts are simply these. There is an old rule of the Home Office that no official must communicate anything to the Press without the approval of the Home Secretary, and Sir Charles, either in ignorance or defiance of this rule, published his now famous article in Murrays Magazine. Mr Matthews, instead of dealing with the matter in a courteous and moderate spirit, as might be expected with an official of the importance of the Chief Commissioner, instructed one of the clerks in the department to send him a curt letter, calling his attention to the regulations. Sir Charles, as I think, unwisely replied by a letter of defiance to Mr Matthews, denying his authority and at the same time tendering his resignation, as it was a perfectly untenable position for the Head of the Police Department to proclaim himself independent of the Cabinet Minister in whose department of the Government the maintenance of the public peace resides. Mr Matthews saw his chance of getting rid of his troublesome subordinate, and at once accepted his resignation.But Sir Charles carries away all the honours  while his friends cannot deny that he made a grand tactical blunder in claiming a position practically independent of the Cabinet and of Parliament itself, they must regard him as the victim of the pure hostility of Mr Matthews.No successor has at the time I write been designated for Sir Charles. It is understood that the Government favour the appointment of a civilian. The names of several gentlemen have been spoken of  some of very high position  but it seems not unlikely that the choice will fall on the chief constable or chief of police of one of the great provincial towns. The name of Mr Howard Vincent has been spoken of, but I dont think there is the least chance of his being selected. Lord Charles Beresford has been also mentioned, but I have little idea of his appointment."

The locality is within the quarter of a mile radius commonto the previous murders, and within a stones throw of, and between thescene of the death place of Catherine Eddows [sic] in Mitre-square andthat of the Millers-court murder. It is stated that the police and agentleman called Backert, who took a leading part in the Vigilanceproceedings last year, have recently received letters from ""Jack theRipper,"" stating that he would recommence his work in July. I supposewe shall witness a revival of the terror which convulsed Whitechapellast autumn. And can we wonder at it or blame the people, who willfeel how entirely helpless they are in the presence of such a danger.LATEST NEWS.London, Thursday.[CENTRAL NEWS AND OTHER TELEGRAMS.]ANOTHER EAST END TRAGEDY.""JACK THE RIPPER"" AGAIN AT WORK.There seems to be little doubt that the murder which took place in CastleAlley, Whitechapel, early yesterday morning was the work of the miscreantwho last year perpetrated the series of horrible crimes which made thedistrict so notorious. The victim in this tragedy has been identified asa woman named Alice Mackenzie [McKenzie]. The mutilation of the body wasnot so extensive as in previous cases, but the theory is that this wasbecause the murderer was disturbed before he had time to complete hisghastly task. Several arrests were made yesterday, but after a shortdetention the men were discharged. The inquest was opened last eveningand was adjourned till to-day.LATEST DETAILSThis morning, at the Working Lads Institute, Whitechapel, Mr Wynne Baxter,coroner for South-East London [sic], resumed the inquiry into the death ofAlice Mackenzie, who was found murdered in Castle Alley, yesterday morning.- The first witness called was detective-Inspector Reid. He said: I receiveda call about five minutes past one oclock and went to Castle Alley at once.I found the alley was guarded by policemen at the Wentworth-street end. Isaw the body of the deceased lying on the pavement, I saw the cut in the leftside of the throat and a quantity of blood had run into the gutter towardsWentworth-street. Her clothes were up and she was lying on her back. I felther face and legs and found they were warm. Dr Phillips then arrived. Searchwas made in the neighbourhood. Underneath the body of the deceased was foundthis clay pipe, which I now produce. It was covered with blood, and had someunburnt tobacco in it. I also found a bronze farthing, which I also produce.There was blood on it. The fence on the other side of the alley to where thebody was found is about 10 feet high. Close to where the body was found weresome barrows chained together. There are altogether five lamps in Castle Alley.I do not think a stranger would go down Castle Alley unless he was taken down.Two Police constables are constantly passing through Castle Alley all night.It is hardly ever left alone for five minutes. Although it is called an alley,it is a narrow court leading into a broad turning, there being also anothernarrow entrance. Any stranger looking at it from Wentworth-street would lookupon it as a blind street. It was raining when the body was removed. The spotwhere deceased was lying was dry, except where there was blood. I searcheddeceased at the mortuary. Her clothing was in a filthy condition, and I shouldthink she was one of the lowest type of unfortunates. There is no doubt thedeed was committed on the spot where the woman was found. No person unlessthey went along the path could have seen the body. It was necessary to usethe constables lamp in order to see the cut in the womans throat. - By theJury: The pipe had not been smoked, and was what they termed in a lodginghouse a ""nose warmer."" - Mrs Smith, recalled, said the laundry closed at eightoclock, and the baths at ten oclock, but it was usually 11 oclock beforeall the men were gone. - Dr George Baxter Phillips, divisional surgeon ofpolice to the H Division, spoke to being summoned at one oclock to CastleAlley and seeing the body under the gas lamp. - Yesterday he made a post mortemexamination. Rigor Mortis was well marked, especially in the limbs, the body wasstill warm. On one of the legs was a well defined bruise about the size of ashilling, and on the right side, an inch below the junction of the collar bone,with the breast bone was a large well defined bruise. Seven inches below theright nipple, in a line continuous with it, commenced an external wound seveninches long, and deepest at its middle part. It only divided the skin andsubcutaneous tissues, but did not divide any muscular structure, and did notcommunicate with the internal cavity of the abdomen. There were seven scoredwounds, and from the middle of the larger wound were nine other scored wounds,reaching only through the skin. - The wound in the neck was four inches long,reaching from the top of the neck into the muscles, which were almost entirelydivided. It reached from the fore part of the neck to a point four inches belowthe chin. It must have taken a somewhat upward direction, and judging by varioussmaller wounds, the first incision seemed to have been interrupted by theprominence of the lower jaw. There was a second incision, which he took it wascommenced from behind, immediately below the first described incision. The secondincision joined the first incision in its deepest part, which was immediately overthe carotid vessels, which were entirely severed down to the spinal column. Thesecond wound was about four inches below the angle of the mouth. He had not theslightest doubt the cause of death was syncope, arising from loss of blood, andthat such death probably was almost instantaneous. There was not any division ofthe upper portion or any portion of the air passages. - The Coroner, addressingthe jury, said the doctor desired to preserve certain points, and he, therefore,proposed the further examination of Phillips should be postponed until after theadjournment, which was fixed for August 14th, at 10 a.m.There are no persons in custody at present in connection with the murder.IS THE MURDERER LEFT HANDED?Having described the nature and position of the wound on the neck, the New YorkHerald (London Edition) says:- This shows clearly two things - the first beingthat the man stood behind her. The second is a bit of evidence that may turn outto be very important. It is that the murderer is left-handed; no right-handedman could, by any possibility, have made the wound that appeared.The theory that most generally prevails is that the murderer is a religious crank,who imagines he has a mission to perform, and like the fanatics of Mahomets time,the more atrocious the butcheries he performs the greater the saint he thinks himself.A WOMANS STORY.Telegraphing at nine p.m., the Central News says:- The murderer still remainsundiscovered, and the police have as far as is known no clue to work upon.Early this morning a woman reported at a police station in Walworth, SouthLondon, that she was accosted last night in Bishopsgate by a man who said helived in Walworth, and persuaded her to accompany him there. As they passedalong an unfrequented thoroughfare he attempted to force her down on theground, and when she screamed drew a long-bladed knife and threatened torip her up. She, however, continued to call for help, and as footsteps wereheard approaching her assailant decamped. He was pursued by a passer-by, butsucceeded in escaping. The woman described the man as of dark complexion,about 5 feet 9 inches in height, and wearing black clothes. The descriptionhas been circulated throughout the Metropolitan police district. The policeauthorities decline to state whether they consider the incident may affordany help in elucidating the Whitechapel mystery. The Peterborough policesaid that Alice MacKenzie, who was murdered in Castle Alley, was not anative of that city. Six months ago she was arrested there on a charge ofvagrancy, being intoxicated when arrested. Nothing was previously known ofher. She said she came from Scotland.LIST OF THE EAST-END MURDERS.Since Christmas week in 1887 eight women have been murdered in the East Endunder mysterious circumstances, five of them within a period of eight weeks.The following are the dates of the crimes and names of the victims so faras known:-Christmas week, 1887. - An unknown woman, found murdered near Osborne andWentworth-streets, Whitechapel.August 7, 1888. - Martha Turner, found stabbed in 39 places on a landingin model dwellings known as George Yard Buildings, Commercial-street,Spitalfields.August 31. - Mrs. Nicholls, murdered and mutilated in Bucks Row, Whitechapel.September 7. - Mrs. Chapman, murdered and mutilated in Hanbury-street,Whitechapel.September 30. - Elizabeth Stride, found with her throat cut in Berner-street,Whitechapel.September 30. - Mrs Eddowes.

Dr. Barnardo made arrangements for sendingthe child to Canada, and when the mother demanded its return he handed it over toa lady who took it to France. Steps having been taken in the English Courts toobtain the return of the child, Dr. Barnardo wrote to the lady, who refused toreturn it because she believed that it had been ill-treated by its naturalguardians. - The Master of the Rolls in delivering judgement said Dr. Barnardo,in his zeal for his own benevolent objects, had overlooked the rights of thepeople and the law of the country. Having done so he must take the consequences,and he was accordingly committed to prison."

The original and Simon pure Jack was safely locked up in an English insane asylum some time ago, and, if he is not dead, he is undoubtedly there yet, for even if he showed signs of returning sanity, the managers of the asylum would not be so insane themselves as to turn him loose again. The celebrated alienist, Dr. Edward C. Spitzka, tells how a lunatic called upon him while the Whitechapel excitement was on, and asked for treatment for his malady. Dr. Spitzka listened to the man's story, questioned him closely, investigated all the facts bearing upon the case, and became convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that his patient was an insane physician and none other than the famous criminal for whom all the English detectives were scouring the country. Other alienists, as well as the police authorities, gave the matter minute examination and agreed with Dr. Spitzka. The Bavarian police have caught only a gross impostor or a rank imitator."

They immediately retired and, as nothing was seen of them this morning, the door of their room was broken in.On the bed lay the woman covered with blood. She had been dead for hours. Her abdomen was ripped open with a dull, broken table knife that lay on the blood. Her viscera had been cut, and from the appearance part of them were missing. The man had escaped. The police think he is ""Jack the Ripper.""The Coroner made a hasty examination of the body and found the woman had been dead for a number of hours. He removed her clothes from her face and neck. A ghastly visage was revealed. The tongue was out and the nose flattened to the face and about the neck was a circle of congealed blood. The appearance of the face convinced the Coroner that she had first been strangled and then the throat had been cut. On turning over the body it was found the murderer had left his mark. The broken end of a knife had been used to cut a large cross on the end of the spine.The housekeeper said the murdered woman's companion was decidedly German in appearance but she could not tell from his appearance how long he had been in this country. She said he resembled a sea faring man. The murdered woman was a well-known character around the neighborhood. The police are scouring the city and the vessels around the dock for the murderer.The woman could not have been much under 60 years of age. Her hair was almost white, and her features stamped with the marks of drunkenness and the gutter. She was a typical specimen of the woman of the slums.The man was apparently not over 32 years of age. In build, he was slight and of medium height, with light complexion, small blonde mustache and blonde hair. He did not utter a word in the hearing of any person about the hotel, and the murder must have been a noiseless one, as the other rooms on the same floor were occupied, and a whisper could almost be heard through the partitions.When the boy pushed open the door of the room this morning he beheld such a scene of horror as he will not forget to his dying day. Stretched out on the bed, naked from the waist down, lying on the right side with both arms twisted and bent under her, her head enveloped in fold after fold of cloth, the old woman lay stark dead on a mattress soaked with blood. She had been completely disembowelled and the terrible result of the operation was drawn out and scattered over the entire lower part of the room. Whether any of the parts are missing, as was the case with the London murders, has not yet been fully ascertained. When the coverings were removed from the face the expression was one of agony. The old woman evidently struggled hard before being strangled.A doctor who saw the body says: ""Whether by chance or skill, the cut was made so as to effect the object aimed at by the London Jack the Ripper, namely, the removal of the uterus."""

The mystic code which regulates the lives of these enemies of society is in many cases a survival of fetichism of the oldest kind. Believing tenaciously in the dread efficacy of certain ghastly charms and incantations, the malefactor boldly enters on his enterprise occasionally carrying with him ""a dead man's hand"" - taken from one who had died a violent death. Such a charm being supposed to over power with sleep those who come under its influence, it is naturally an invaluable adjunct to the implements employed with thieves, says the Pall Mall Budget.Some years ago an attempted robbery was made by burglars on an estate in the county Meath, and, to quote a contemporary account of the affair, ""they entered the house armed with a dead man's hand, with a lighted candle in it, believing that a candle so placed will not be seen by any but those by whom it is used, and also that if a candle in a dead man's hand be introduced in a house it will prevent those who may be asleep from awakening. The inmates, however, were alarmed; the robbers fled, leaving the dead man's hand behind them.""Many similar stories are told of the use of the dead hand by thieves, one communicated by Rev. S. Baring Gould being worthy of notice. Two men, having come to lodge in a public house with a view to robbing it, asked permission to pass the night by the fire, and obtained it. When the house was quiet, the servant girl, suspecting mischief, crept downstairs, and looked through the keyhole, when she saw the men open a sack and take out a dry, withered hand. They anointed the fingers with some unguent, and lighted them. Each finger flamed except the thumb, which indicated that one of the household was not asleep.Grose gives a full account of this charm as used by French housebreakers, and a variation of the same belief prevailed in Belgium. Not far from Bailleni, in West Flanders, a thief was captured on whom was found the foot of a man who had been hanged, which he used, when engaged in his robberies, for putting person to sleep. Similar instances are quoted from Spain and Germany, and it is noteworthy that Mexican thieves have been known to carry with them the left hand and arm of a woman who died at the birth of her first child.Then there is the corpse candle, a weird implement of the robber's trade, which, although common throughout Europe, seems to have been more general in Germany than any other country. Not so long ago, it may be remembered, four peasants in the south Russian government of Kursk murdered a girl in order to make candles of her body, the notion being that such a hideous light not only renders the perpetrators of robberies invisible, but actually throws the victim or victims into a state of somnolence. In the German criminal codes of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries we find express mention made of penalties against a crime the motive of which was the making of ""thieves"" or ""sleep producing"" candles. This superstition has figured in many a trial, and seems to be, even to the present day, implicitly believed in by the criminal classes. Indeed, it was suggested that the Whitechapel murders were instigated by this idea - a theory which the celebrated Dr. Bloch, a member of the Austrian reichsrath, was induced to support. An instance of this piece of criminal lore occurred during the trial of the German thief, Theodore Unger, who was executed at Magdeburg in 1810, when it was brought out in evidence that a regular traffic existed for the supply of these grewsome implements of the burglar's trade. But, instead of making the criminal invisible, this grim light has more than once done the reverse, and caused him to be brought to justice."

Orange Washington and Gracie  Vance, living with Washington as his wife, and two mulatto girls, Lucinda Boddy and Sofy Gibson occupied the cabin. Coming  out with a gun Mr. Dunham found Lucinda scuffling with a man at the gate and he might have shot him, had the girl not caught  Mr. Dunham in her agony and fright in such a way as to unintentionally prevent his shooting. This resulted in the man's  escaping, though a number of shots were fired at him by others. Washington was found senseless and soon died. The two girls  were, as one of them says, knocked senseless with a sandbag. She thinks from his voice, as he ordered her to keep quiet, that  Doc Woods was the man. Gracie Vance was found to have been dragged through the window, thrown over the fence and dragged some  distance from the cabin, where evidence of a severe struggle indicated that she had probably been outraged and then beaten to  death with a rock which was found near by smeared with blood. A watch was found on her person with the chain tied around her  arm. A horse was also found saddled and tied to a tree near the scene of the tragedy. These facts may lead to the identity of  the murderer should Woods be the wrong man. His brother, Doug. Woods, has been arrested on suspicion of being an accessory,  if not principal, in the murder; also Beverly Overton, another negro who owns the horse, but claims it was stolen from him.  The police claim the watch had been stolen also. If so, it may have been tied to the arm as a device to fasten suspicion on  the owner, Doc Woods was afterwards arrested and identified by Lucinda Boddy as the criminal."

Mr. Mansfield was born in London thirty one years ago, and his great artistic gifts came to him by the  laws of heredity for his mother, Mme. Erminin Rudersdorff, was one of the rarest lyric artists of her time. Sixteen years ago  Mme. Rudersdorff and her two sons came to America, the mother then being under engagement to Mr. P. S. Gilmore to sing at the  Boston Peace Jubilee. He was in his 20th year when Mme. Rudersdorff decided that he should enter upon a commercial career,  and secured him a position in the great dry goods house of Jordan and Marsh, in Boston.He did not continue long at this, however, and when he was 21 went to London to study art. He acquired a reputation for  mimicry rather than art, which brought him to the attention of the German, Reeds, and he was regularly engaged at a good  salary to appear with Corney Grain. On the first night, worn out by exhaustion and frenzied with the excitement of his new  position, which meant either a career or abject failure, he fainted and failed. But he was given another trial, made a  success, and got what was more valuable - his name before the press and public in a way that attracted the attention of the  London managers.Then followed a time of upward work. He played Brigard in ""Frou frou"", the Admiral and other leading parts in Gilbert and  Sullivan operas. Under D'Oyly Carte's management he appeared to New York six years ago. At the end of the first season on the  American stage Richard Mansfield found himself a star.Mr. Mansfield's recent achievement in his presentation of his marvelous psychological studies of Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is  universally conceded to be among the few really remarkable stage creations contemporaneous history has afforded.Daniel E. Bandmann, who was a star when Mansfield was in his swaddling clothes, became a rival to Mr. Mansfield in this wise:  Bandmann sent a request for tickets for himself and friends to Mansfield's performance. Mansfield replied that he didn't give  tickets to dime museum people - Bandmann has of late played at ""popular prices"" - whereupon Herr Bandmann determined to play  the part himself.Bandmann was born at Cassel, Germany, and made his debut at the age of 18 at the Court theatre of New Strelitz. After making  reputation in the Shakespearean drama in Germany he came to America, and for the first time played in English, as Shylock, at  Niblo's garden, New York, Jan. 15, 1863. For about five years he starred. He pleased Edwin Forrest, and was selected by him  to play hamlet in the tercentenary birthday celebration at Philadelphia. Feb. 17, 1869, he appeared at the Lyceum Theatre,  London. and created a strong impression in ""Narcisse.""In 1877 he played Hamlet and Othello in Berlin. In 1884 Bandmann began an engagement at the Thalia Theatre, New York. Some  seasons ago he adopted the circuit of cheap theatres.Bandmann, having made arrangements to play the celebrated double character in England, secured a London theatre in order to  open ahead of Mansfield, who was to have opened at Irving's Lyceum Theatre on Sept.3. Mansfield's going sooner is to outwit  the outwitter."

He is a character half way between Dickens' Quilp and Poe's  baboon. He is short, stunted and thick set. He has small, wicked black eyes and is half crazy. He was always hanging about  the deep shadows that filled the network of the courts, passages and alley ways in White Chapel. He did not walk, but always  moved on a sharp or queer run and never made any noise with his feet. In addition to the three women he murdered he scared a  hundred more of them nearly to death, and every street walker in White Chapel has her own story to tell of him. He lived by  robbing them late at night and kicked, cuffed or knocked down two score of them in the last two years. His usual lodging  place wa a four-penny house in a poverty stricken thieves' alley off Brick Lane. He has left there, now, however, and nobody  knows where he is. He is suspected of having done the three murders from the fact that he has frequently drawn a knife on  women, accompanied by the same threats which have been carried out on the dead women. The story of Mrs. Colwall, who heard  the screams of the woman as she was being murdered, is that she was clearly running away from somebody who was murdering her,  and yet she could hear no other footsteps. The blood stains on the sidewalk indicated the same thing - that the murderer, who  ever he was, was noiseless in his pursuit, and this quality points direct to Leather Apron. He is a slipper maker by trade and  gets his nickname from the fact he always wears a leather apron, and is never seen without it. One peculiar feature of the  case is that none of the police or detectives appear to know him, he having always kept out of their sight, and they are now  gleaning information concerning him from women he has assailed."

One of them was found in Berner Street with her throat cut from  ear to ear. The other was discovered lying in Mitre square. She, like the first mentioned victim, had her throat cut, but in  addition she had been disemboweled and her nose had been cut off. The murderer had evidently been disturbed in his work in  Berner  street and had no time to mutilate the body of his victim. The discovery of the bodies completely paralyzed the  police and General Sir Charles Warren, chief commissioner, was at once called out of bed. He repaired immediately to the  scene of the murder and gave orders to have the police force in that district reinforced.The first murder occurred shortly after midnight, in a narrow court leading from the street and directly beneath the windows  of a socialist club composed of foreigners. A concert was in progress in the club rooms at the time and a large number of  persons were present, but not a sound was heard from the victim. The second murder occurred three-quarters of an hour later  in Mitre square, five minutes walk from the scene of the first tragedy. The police patrol the square every ten minutes but  the murderer to elude them. The vigilance committee will resume their patrol of the district, extending their lines of  watchfulness. The woman murdered in Berner street has been identified as Elizabeth Stride, a native of Stockholm and an  inmate of a low lodging. The identity of the other woman has not yet been established.London is a fever of excitement and the denizens of Whitechapel are in a state of terror, owing to the resumption of the  horrible butcheries, the fourth of which it was hoped and quite generally believed, would be the last of the ghastly series.  The number of theories advanced accounting for the murders and seeking to establish the identity of the murderer is  positively bewildering, but not one of them is accepted by the police as the correct one, although the Scotland Yard  detectives have nothing to offer themselves. The absolutely impotent condition of the police in the matter has led them,  however, to catch at straws in the way of evidence, and the most significant of these is a letter which was received at the  office of the Central News Company Thursday afternoon. The letter is familiarly addressed ""Dear Boss,"" and signed ""Jack the  Ripper."" After boasting that he had committed all of the Whitechapel murders, the writer continues, ""I love my work and want  to start at it again. The next job I do I shall cut off the lady's ear and send it to the police. Keep this letter back till  I do a bit more work and then give it out to the police straight.""A remarkable feature of the Mitre square murder is that one of the dead woman's ears is severed, and this circumstance is  held to indicate that the real murderer wrote the letter. Most of the newspapers issued  special editions giving copious  details of the tragedies. Great crowds visited the scene of the murders yesterday, and gazed at the blood-stained pavement  with a degree of fascination difficult for the police to overcome in their efforts to keep the highways clear. The lodging  houses, alleys, etc, of the Whitechapel district are being scoured by detectives."

The plainest statement of the facts excites anger, pity  and disgust. Ina few weeks seven women of the lowest class of unfortunates to be found in the notorious slums of Whitechapel  have been found dead in the streets: in each case the corpse was shockingly mutilated, and in all but one the whole internal  organ of reproduction was removed, the line of section indicating that the act was done by a person versed in the anatomy of  the parts, and skillful with the surgeon's knife. In the one case where this was not done, the body was still warm and  bleeding, indicating that the perpetrator had been frightened away before completing his hideous task.During the same period the corpse of a woman similarly mutilated was found in a town in the north of England; and if, as is  likely, the murderer was the same, this makes his eighth victim. The first two cases excited no great interest, as quarrels  and murders are no new thing in the Whitechapel district; but the horrible monotony of the crimes has since made this a case  of world wide note. It recalls the cases of the noted French marquis of two centuries ago, who is said to have killed 200  females of all ages, of the French medical student who confessed to killing seventeen women, of Jesse Pomeroy, the boy  murderer, and many others.Alienists are unanimous in the opinion that the murderer is a monomaniac with a homicidal turn; and many add that he is what  medical science calls a ""sexual pervert"" - that is, a man in whom the natural instincts have been changed by disease or  excess into a blind hatred and desire to kill and mangle. Such cases are not so uncommon as the unlearned would suppose. In  the notorious Bender murders in Labette county, Kan., in1878, all the victims were men except that the little daughter of one  man, traveling with her father, was killed with him; and in each case the mutilations were unmentionable. As none of the  portions of the bodies removed were found, the people concluded that Kate Bender, the directing genius of the gang, who  claimed wonderful healing powers and converse with extra-human agencies, had used them in the vile incantations she  practiced. It is not easy for the healthy mind to conceive of such degraded creatures; yet medical history records many  similar cases, nearly all men. Women murderers nearly always resort to poison, as even the most depraved retain their natural  horror of blood; but with men the exact opposite is true. The homicidal man maniac takes a wild joy in seeing the flow of  blood, in looking on the ghastly wounds and the writhings of his victim.The London police have been completely at sea, and some of the theories put forth by their chiefs are too absurd for one's  patience. One, for instance, was that an American medical student did the deeds because he wanted to collect a number of  anatomical specimens! The most reasonable theory is that the monomaniac has been injured, or thinks he has, by one of these  women, and is wreaking his vengeance on the class. His cunning is wonderful - not an uncommon thing in monomaniacs. Dr.  William Hammond, the eminent alienist, very sensible says the police have gone wrong from the start, because they have looked  only for a self evident villain, a man ""whose face would go far to hang him"", while the probabilities are many to one that  the perpetrator is a decorous and soft spoken gentleman, living an apparently virtuous life, a man whose closest  acquaintances do not suspect of crime. Such was the appearance of the noted De Retz, the French ""Bluebeard"" above referred  to, and of the young man who confessed to seventeen murders. Incidentally, it may be noted that Kate Bender was not at all  unattractive, and that Jesse Pomeroy was what many people would call a ""fine looking boy."" He was sent to the Massachusetts  state's prison for life, and though the papers stated that Kate escaped, there are men in Kansas who could show you the very  spot where she, her half witted brother and her parents were laid beneath the prairie sod.Chief Inspector Byrnes, of New York city, accepts the opinion of Dr. Hammond and insists that the New York police could have  caught the man by using the women as decoys. He added:""We caught the fellow who had a mania for throwing vitriol upon womens' dresses red handed immediately after it was reported.  His crime was localized. He frequented Fourteenth street. I made victims for him, and my men were thickly scattered through  that district. We have no such autocratic powers as the London police, but if a crime is so plainly localized in one  particular district, as in the case of these London murders, we would most assuredly arrest the perpetrator in short order."""
39,index/atchison_daily_globe_18881016.txt,atchison_daily_globe,1888-10-16,"Atchison Daily GlobeKansas, USA16 October 1888THE POLICE OF LONDONSCOTLAND YARD, THE ORGANIZATION'S HEADQUARTERS Some facts to Regard Thereon and Considered Timely by the Terrible Murders in Whitechapel, One of the Lowest Slums in the Great Metropolis of the World. London has been more stirred up by the Whitechapel murders than by any crime committed in many years. The fact that so many women could be slaughtered, evidently by the same hand, and the murderer for so long a time elude the London police is a surprise to Londoners, who believe that they have the best police force in the world. However, it is the London detective force, rather than the police force, whose especial duty it is to seek out the authors of crime, though detectives are really but a higher grade of police. In 1877 the London detective force was reorganized, since when it has been regarded remarkably efficient. Previous to that time the force consisted of several detectives in each district, under the direction of the superintendent or captain of the district, and of thirty en at the central office at Scotland Yard. There were, therefore, a number of independent detachments. On April 8, 1878, a reform went into operation, the object of which was to consolidate the force, and to centralize the authority under which it worked. As reformed, the control of the force is in the hands of a new department, that of criminal investigation, which is under the charge of the director of Scotland Yard. In each city division there is a local inspector, who has charge of the detectives of his division, and who is supposed to be a representative of the director, though really under the control of the superintendent. Whether the system is too cumbersome or too systematic for practical detective work, investigation is carried on pretty independently by divisions, but the idea of Scotland Yard being the center from which all detetctive work is guided is still kept alive among the people. The inspectors meet there from time to time; local superintendents send there reports of crimes which have been committed during the previous twenty four hours every morning, and the director is supposed to issue the instructions regarding them, but practically the inspectors are independent, for the matter of any crime is usually remanded to them. The detective force of London consists of 400 men in summer and 700 in winter. They are chosen from the police for their ingenuity in tracking criminals, so far as that is apparent. The Scotland Yard force consists of eighty men, nearly all of whom rank as inspectors. This force has so long been the focus of observation in criminal investigation, it has been called upon so often to assist the novelist, especially one whose plot covers a crime, or one who writes detective stories, that its reputation has become worldwide from this source alone, without considering the many remarkable criminal cases with which it has had to do. Novelists, however, have often taken great liberties with Scotland Yard rules. The force is used for London alone, a London detective being scarcely ever sent anywhere else. Yet many a story teller has summoned a Scotland Yard detective to help him out with his plot, to go where his chief would not think of sending him. But with the novelist all things are possible; the inspector arrives, and if the ingenuity of the real detective and his luck were a tithe of what they are in the novel, no guilty man would ever escape. The force is under the direct orders of the assistant commissioner. It investigates notable crimes like the Whitechapel murders, but its principal business is embezzlements, forgeries and other similar matters. It also does a great deal of government work, both for the British crown and for the governments of foreign countries. The force also is expected to investigate all applications for naturalization and attend popular gatherings, besides keeping an eye in all professional criminals who may be at large. Once a week a Scotland Yard detective goes to the city prisons to look at the prisoners awaiting trial and see if any are known to him. The foreign correspondence is an important item. Formerly this work was done by a force of civil service clerks. Now it is all done at Scotland Yard, and each letter received is replied to in the language in which it is written. There is, doubtless, much variety and excitement in the work of a detective. He must take what clew he has, if any, and follow the dictates of his own ingenuity. Often he ingratiates himself into the confidences of the suspected criminal, and detectives have been known to live with a criminal for months before getting the proof required for conviction. Recently in Chicago at an anarchist trial one of the prisoners, who was being pressed too hard by the questions of a lawyer, stepped aside from among the criminals and began to chat familiarly with the prosecuting attorney. He proved to be a detective who had been so familiar with the accused as to be arrested and tried for the offense they had committed. "

All the world remembers how much  Sir Charles banked upon his bloodhounds and how he made himself a laughing stck of everybody by letting them chase his august  person one every early morning not long ago. One would imagine that his experience would have shaken his faith in the wisdom  of the scheme, for, so the account runs, they only succeeded in making even a fair showing one time in three.The fact is, almost any one conversant with the employment of hounds for tracking persons will tell you, it is quite a  different matter for a dog to take up and follow a scent across a sparsely settled country, and through the intricate mazes  of a densely populated city.It is not at all uncommon for a dog to quite lose the scent in the former instance because of one crossing track. In a  crowded metropolitan district like Whitechapel, where any given track would be criss-crossed by tens of thousands of other  tracks inside of an hour, the task of following the murderer by the scent would be altogether beyond the power of even the  keenest nosed dog.And even if Sir Charles' experiments had been successful to a marked degree, the results would have justified no sanguine  expectations. For the experiments were made early in the morning when few people would be stirring, and the chance of  obliteration by subsequent trails would be at the minimum, whereas the search for the murderer would, very likely, have to be  made at a busy time of the day.When Sir Charles lost the dogs he was trying them in the open country. They had been taken to a common in the suburbs and  there ""laid on scent after scent.""Whether they showed any progress in the noble art of man hunting is not stated, but when let loose on what proved to be their  last run they were ""lost sight of altogether"", and ""the men in charge were frantic."" Certain carpers at Sir Charles' method  of running the police department have suggested that ""perhaps some smart dog fancier has made a greart haul of the prize  hounds.""It is quite possible that this last exploit of Sir Charles Warren will move the London publications that sail under comic  colors to the printing of cartoons bearing upon the subject. Punch has already devoted considerable attention to the  Whitechapel matter, and here is a reduced reproduction of one of its cartoons, heading and all:THE NEMESIS OF NEGLECT IS SHOWN HERESir Charles Warren is a most extraordinary person, if we may believe the English newspaper stories about him. He doesn't seem  to have the slightest qualification for the position of chief of police, and the office came to him only because he was born  with patrician blood in his veins.He has been a soldier, and a fairly good one, too - serving abroad - and therein, perhaps, lies much of the secret of his ill  success. If he had been willing to act simply as a figure head, let other and more capable men attend to the executive part  - the real work of the department - matters would probably never have reached such a pass as to render the Whitechapel  murders possible.But, having won some reputation as a fighter of savages, he felt that he knew just how to preserve order in a city largely  composed of civilized people. Brooking no interference with his plan of conducting the affairs of the office of chief of  police on the lines of a military campaign, and fully imbued with the idea that the chief end of the police is to suppress  free speech and all sympathy with the Irish, whom he hates so bitterly, he devoted his energies to closing public places to  speakers who are dissatisfied with the existing order of things in England and the following and arrest of Americans and  others supposed to have a friendly feeling towards Erin's green isle. Of course it was not long before the Scotland Yard men  and the ""bobbies"" alike expended whatever abilities they possess in these directions, and what are on other countries are  considered the most hateful classes flourished unhurt and plied their criminal callings unmolested. In this connection are  presented portraits of Inspector Helstone and Coroner Baker, two officials who have ably seconded Sir Charles Warren's policy  of marked incapability."

To describe the central section of this  district in terms fit for refined readers is not possible. It combines the worst features of old ""St Giles"", as London  novelists once described it; of the Five Points of New York as it was in 1850 and of the Chinese quarters of San Francisco,  and has, in addition, some local horrors of its own. WHAT WHITECHAPEL IS.It is a tangled wilderness of narrow streets and shut alleys, dark lanes and dirty courts, surrounded by vile gin shops and  viler lodging houses. It is the center of the noted East End of London, and lies on both sides of the broad Whitechapel road,  which is the main outlet in that direction through Stratford and Ilford into the agricultural districts of Essex. The  population of Whitechapel may be broadly divided into three classes: The fairly well to do tradesmen, the industrious but ill  paid artisans, and the hopeless, homeless, helpless thousands of unemployed who drag out an existence from day to day as  devoid of ease and comfort as any of God's creatures on this broad earth. Common lodging houses abound in Whitechapel, and  wretched and miserable as are every variety of these refuges of the destitute and desolate, the East End ""padding kens"" enjoy  an unenviable notoriety as the filthiest and most disreputable of their kind.Within a very small territory, which is traversed by but five streets of any width beside the Whitechapel road, are crowded  at least 150,00 human beings; and there vice prevails in its most revolting forms. By day the district is comparatively  quiet; but soon after nightfall all the ""gin palaces"" are lighted up, dark red lanterns shine dimly in the narrow passages  leading to the inner courts, the occasional sound of music is heard from a low concert room a cellar ""dive"", and the streets  are thronged by reckless sailors, adventurous apprentices, curious visitors and the regular habitues of the locality. And  among the latter are hundreds of women whose only care is to procure the means for one day's food, one night's lodging, and  the fiery liquor which temporarily drowns reason and remorse. Of course, many of these women are accomplices in robbery; and  there are houses in the narrower streets lying off the main thoroughfares in which every facility is afforded for hocusing  and robbing the already half drunken prey of these painted jezebels. Scarcely a day passes but a tale of daring robbery is  unfolded in th adjacent police court, in which these women and their contemptible male companions figure as the despoilers of  inebriated sailors or workmen.Such is Whitechapel; such are its inhabitants and visitors, and such are the women from whom this modern ghoul selects his  victims. The reader will see at once why the case presents almost insuperable difficulties to the police. Not only is the  environment the best for murder, but the victims naturally avoid the police, and conduct the murderer to the most secret  places.WORK OF THE FIENDThe First Murder Was in August and Attracted Little AttentionIn August 1887 (sic) the first of these murders occurred; but it was only noticed as a curious variation of the many murders  in Whitechapel. On the morning of Aug. 7, this year, a policeman on his regular beat in the rear of old Whitechapel church  found the body of a poorly clad woman on the pavement in front of a row of small houses standing in a blind alley. Day was  just breaking when the officer found the body. She was quite dead and her throat was cut from ear to ear. A subsequent  examination of the remains disclosed the fact that she had been disemboweled after death.At the inquest the body was identified as that of one Martha Turner, a social outcast well known to the police of the  district as an habitual frequenter of the Whitechapel road. The police, aided by Scotland Yard and city detectives, worked  hard on the case but failed to obtain the slightest clew to the murderer.On Aug. 31, just before daybreak, a policeman found another woman of the same class, named Mary Ann Nicholls, lying dead,  with her throat cut in precisely the same manner as Martha Turner's had been and with the same nameless outrages committed  upon the body after death. The body of his second victim was found in Buck's court, a narrow thoroughfare running off Brady  street and only 200 yards distant from the scene of the first murder. The woman Nicholls was well known in the neighborhood,  but all efforts to discover a motive for her assassination or the wretch who butchered her proved completely abortive.The third murder brought the matter to the attention of newspaper readers everywhere, and scores of curious theories were  offered. The police force of the neighborhood was double, scores of detectives from other districts were dropped into the  district. Citizens by the hundred patrolled the streets throughout the nights, suspicious looking men prowling around after  dark were arrested on suspicion by the score, but the murderer remained at large. Exactly a week later, almost to the very  hour, a policeman discovered the dead body of Annie Sievey in the open doorway of a tenement house in Hanbury street, a  narrow lane at the back of one of the great Whitechapel breweries. Again the victim was an ""unfortunate"", and again her throat  was cut from ear to ear, but in his devilish treatment of the remains the fiend had exhibited an accession of blood curdling  brutality hitherto unprecedented in the annals of barbarous and revolting crimes. He had actually torn out the woman's heart  and laid it across the face along with the viscera.THE POLICE BEGIN WORK.The police redoubled their efforts; all the lodging houses of the district were polled, and every man required to give an  account of himself. Many men were arrested, but proved innocent; but at length the public mind settled down to the belief that  a wild looking, half insane Israelite of the vicinity was the guilty man. The police held him some time, but it was easily  proved that he spent his evenings indoors, and that he had not the physical strength which circumstances show the murderer to  possess. It is a curious fact, by the way, that the worst murders were perpetrated in a region occupied almost entirely by  foreigners, and one of them under the very windows of a club house used by Socialists from eastern Europe.The fourth murder completed the chain of evidence as to the general nature of the crimes. It was demonstrated that the  murderer possessed great strength; that he was able to prevent his victims from making an outcry; that he probably killed at  a single blow; that his animosity, or whatever the motive is, was directed against a single class, or that he considered them  safer victims; that robbery was not a motive, and that he was probably actuated by a monomaniacal frenzy not inconsistent  with apparent sanity in other matters, of which mental and moral perversion history unhappily gives many instances. And on  these facts local opinion attributed the murders to a mysterious person called ""Leather Apron"", because he wore one of those  articles and no one knew his real name. No one can remember having seen this man in daytime, and he has not arrested; but  some of the women of the quarter testify that he was often seen at night, and that he wore a shoemaker's knife under his  apron. Since the search became very vigorous he has not been seen.THE MURDER AT GATESHEAD.There was a pause of two weeks, and then a woman of the same class was found dead and similarly mutilated in Gateshead. This  is part of the great northern English seaport and manufacturing town, Newcastle-on-Tyne. Newcastle lies on one side of the  river Tyne and Gateshead on the other. The two towns are connected by three bridges. The iron foundries, locomotive works,  machine shops and many other important industries are located in Gateshead and the contiguous districts of Biker, Walker and  Scotswood. Many thousands of men are employed in the various works, and they and their families reside for the most part in  and around Gateshead. The last year or two fully one fifth of the whole working population of the district, which numbers  over 12,000, have been out of employment, and during last winter but for the establishment and maintenance of a liberal  scheme of outdoor relief hundreds must have literally perished  of hunger. The people are densely ignorant, brutal in their  habits, and live for the most part  in a condition of filthy squalor. The speech of the natives is simply unintelligible to  strangers, and their manners are as rough and harsh as their vernacular. The abandoned women from amongst whom the murderer  here, as in Whitechapel, selected his victim are in Gateshead sunk to the lowest depth of human abasement.ABSURD THEORIES ADVANCED.About this time two curiously absurd stories gained credence. It was said than an American medical student had offered a  large sum for several specimens of the uterus, and that he, or some vile agent of his, was murdering these women to obtain  them. For some time the alleged ""American"" was eagerly looked for; but the fact that such specimens can be obtained at small  expense dissipated that theory. Another was that the murderer was a woman dressed in man's clothes; but no motive could be  conceived. Another theory - that the murderer had suffered robbery or worse by association with such women, and was seeking  revenge - is still maintained by many; but medical men are almost unanimous in the opinion that the perpetrator is simply a  homicidal maniac, probably a ""sexual pervert"" - one in whom the natural instincts have been perverted by disease or excess  into a blind hatred or morbid desire for blood. And while these theories were being discussed the most shocking cases  occurred - two murders within the same midnight hour.A few minutes before midnight of Sept. 29 a woman's corpse, still warm and quivering, was found on the sidewalk on Berners  street, a narrow thoroughfare of the dangerous district; and an added element of amazement lies in the fact that at that hour  there are still many persons on the street, and at that very time the socialists were holding their meeting in a hall near  by. In fact, it was a foreign laborer on his way to the meeting who first discovered the corpse.MOST HORRID WORK.The blood was still flowing, the corpse still warm; the murderer had been frightened away before completing the mutilation,  yet he had lustily slashed and hacked the body. The chief commissioner of police, Sir Charles Warren, was hastily called from  his bed, and ordered all the available policemen into the district. In a short time they found another warm and bleeding  corpse in Mitre square, not ten minutes walk from the scene of the other murder. It was truly a night of horrors. The  murderer, evidently enraged at being driven from his first victim, had rushed to the next convenient spot and slaughtered the  first woman he could secure.He had had time to do his fiendish work thoroughly. The victim's clothes had been thrown over her head and one horrible slash  with a large knife had laid the body open from the pelvis to the ribs. A cross cut had then divided it almost to the  backbone. The viscera had then been torn out and scattered over the corpse, and a great number of small stabs inflicted upon  the corpse. The sight was indescribably horrible. The policeman who discovered the body fainted. The next day was one long to  be remembered in Whitechapel. Not only were all the denizens drawn to the spot by the horrible fascination, but many  thousands from other parts of London. A correspondent of the New York Sun gives the following:""London is dreadfully frightened. Scores of women are hysterical. Tens of thousands could not possibly be induced to stop out  alone. Everyone, of course, expects fresh atrocities, and that is how things stand at present. It is not flattering to the  police nor comforting to Londoners, who imagined themselves well protected. The following tells what is known of the fresh  crimes, which, as an evidence of an almost unprecedented condition of the human mind, are more interesting to the philosopher  even than to the simple citizen who likes to have his blood curdled.THE DEPTHS OF WHITECHAPEL.""Your correspondent has spent from early evening until now, past midnight, wandering through the Whitechapel slums. The best  idea of the awful degradation of the men there can be gathered from a description of the women, whose ability to keep alive  proves the existence of men so low as to consort with them. These wretched women swarm the streets by thousands even now, but  keep close together and look sharply around for murderers, even while pretending to laugh, and asking each other whose turn  to be cut up will come next. The language in which they speak of the fiend who has made it his business to murder them it is  impossible to reproduce. Such profanity and hideously foul language as may be heard coming from the group of women of any  Whitechapel corner can probably not be heard anywhere else. Some of these poor animals have actually grown old in their  misery, shriveled, horrible, gin soaked hags, who fight and quarrel on the gutter's edge, and to approach within yards of  whom is torture.""The younger women, the queens of these slums, are even more distressing to look at. Some are mere girls, almost children,  but all celebrate any stroke of fortune by getting drunk. Bright colors distinguish them. Light blue is the favorite color.  Cheap brocades, dragging in the mud, and ostrich feathers, so sadly out of curl as the dissipated owners' hair, are favorite  outward signs of such prosperity as may be attained in Whitechapel. The poor creatures when born were dropped upon the surface  of the worst pool of degradation that can be boasted by any great city on earth, and all they can do is to sink deeper down  into it, fighting and drinking cheap gin as they go.""Infants crawling through heaps of refuse in the slums, never having been made jealous by the sight of clean, fat babyhood,  were fairly contented, and their parents evidently found their lives much enlivened by the sensation which had come upon  them. The scenes of both murders were swarming with curious crowds, preference being given to the place where the most savage  murder occurred, and up to tonight morbid citizens were busy lighting wax matches in the dark corner of Mitre square trying  to discover blood stains.""SEEKING THE MURDERER.Criticism of the Police - Testimony and False Confessions. Much unjust criticism of the London police has resulted, but a glance at the testimony will convince any one that with such  witnesses and in such a locality it is almost impossible to get a clew. For instance, at the inquest on the body found in  Berners street, a sister of the victim was called and deposed that she awoke and heard kisses and a sound which she thought  was made by a person falling to the ground. She was convinced that her sister was dead, and, after reading the accounts of  the murder in the newspapers, went to the morgue and recognized the body of the murdered woman as that of her sister. As she  lives some distance away, this is taken to prove that the body of the murdered woman was carried to the place where it was  found. But how could the perpetrator do that without getting blood upon his clothing; and how could a man with bloody  clothing escape all scrutiny? To such questions the police have as yet no answer, and the stupidity or drunken indifference,  at the time of the murder, of the friends of the murdered women appears to be such that very little can be learned from them.The inquest on the other body found that night was somewhat more satisfactory. It was shown that the murderer met the women  at some distance from the square and walked with her along the main street that led to the square. It was probably this fact  that caused the murderer to mutilate the face of his victim, as he feared that they had been noticed in company and the  woman's identification would lead to his capture. The faces of the other Whitechapel victims were untouched, while this one's  was hacked beyond recognition. Various measures were then adopted by the people of the east end for their protection, as  little confidence is felt in the police. That night fifty working men, all armed and ready to attack even a blood-thirsty  insane man, patrolled the neighborhood frequented by the murderer. The papers print columns of letters on the subject every  day and suggestions are numerous. The latest is that public prayers shall be said as a means of gaining relief from this  epidemic of murders.The next suggestion was by a sailor named Dodge, who declared that in August last he met a Malay cook named Al Aska, with whom  he had previously been acquainted on  shipboard, in a music hall in London, and that Al Aska told him he had been robbed of  all he had by a woman of the town, and threatened that unless he found the woman and recovered his property he would kill and  mutilate every Whitechapel woman he met. The police searched the city, but no such Malay was found.DELUSIONS OF FEEBLE MINDS.And now appeared one of the strangest phenomena connected with such crimes - one that all criminal history shows to be a  concomitant of popular excitement. People began to ""confess"" - one in person and meny by letter. John Fitzgerald surrendered  himself to the police as the murderer, and apparently thought he was; but he was easily proved to be a feeble hypochondriac.  A letter signed ""Jack the Ripper"" was received by the police. It addresses the chief as ""Dear Old Boss"", confesses to the  murders and says the motive is revenge. Another letter of ""confession"" gives religious conviction as the reason, and alleges  that the writer has a mission to drive all lewd women from London.""FIFTEEN MORE!""On the wall by one of the victims these worlds were rudely scrawled: ""This is five; fifteen more and I give myself up;"" and  various letters in the same strain have been received. During the same time there has been a great increase in robberies and  street outrages in every part of London.Another horror, the seventh for London, came to light on Oct. 2, when a woman's corpse, far advanced in decomposition, was  found within sight of the police headquarters in Scotland Yard. It had been literally hacked to pieces, and a pair of arms  found in another place some time before were probably those of this corpse. One important fact was now proved. When the  murderer wrote on the wall the he had killed five only four were known; it is evident that this last discovered woman was  killed before that time, and the police accept this as evidence that the writer was the wholesale murderer. But whether that  knowledge brings them any nearer catching him is quite another matter. For the present London holds its breath in a sort of  tremulous waiting for another murder.The situation is not without some amusing features, and surely a little of that sort of thing will be a relief after such a  feast of horrors. The Sun correspondent above quoted writes:GRIM HUMOR OF THE CASE.""The greatest effect produced by the series of butcheries has been upon women of a different class. Probably the most  hysterical female in existence just now is the, as a rule, calm and unmoved London chambermaid. When the London fog creeps  down it finds lots of park benches in the West End on which there is neither chambermaid nor soldier. That is beyond all  question an entirely new sensation for the London fog.""A friend has assured me that peace has reigned in his household since Sept. 8, when the terror commenced, because not a  solitary female servant has wanted an evening out. The effect of the murders has not done the gentleman's wife as much good  as it would have done but for the fact that she is most awfully frightened, too. Another friend, less fortunate, finds himself  deprived of the services of his only male servant, as the maids and the cook must have their airing, and won't go out alone.""Theories are being built up by thousands, but they are not worth much. I chanced to hear that of George Lewis, the best  known solicitor in London. He believes the woman killer to be a religious maniac, who has sworn to root out the social evil,  and has adopted the plan in each case of making his punishment so awful as to deter others from evil ways. This view, I  learn, is shared by Sir James Risdon Bennett, an eminent authority on lunacy, who has expressed the opinion that the murderer  imagines himself ordained from above to kill all bad women, and has set about his difficult task with lunatic enthusiasm.CLUMSINESS OF THE POLICE.""Until something is found out London is going to be mighty nervous, and it grows evident that if the murderer is taken it  will be his fault. Detectives in plain clothes, on whom London relies, are swarming in Whitechapel, it is true, but as a rule  they wear regular police boots and go two by two. They may readily be distinguished a block off when it's clear. I would  again advise some American to come over and prove there is still a detective left who can detect.""The London police labor under some peculiar disadvantages. By the last returns they number 10,940, as against 8,250 in Paris  and 3,264 in New York, but London contains three times as many people as New York; is spread over six times the area, and yet  the very poor and the lowest criminal classes are crowded as in New York and their districts are vastly more difficult to  police. A considerable portion of the older part of the city of London is built on the most irregular and confusing lines.  Dark alleys, small courts, squares having but one street of egress, and narrow lanes make up a good part of the great city,  and it would require at least 50,000 policemen properly to cover the whole of London. The stringent police regulations, which  require the emptying of public houses at the hour of 1, while adding to the security of those parts of the British metropolis  where such houses most abound, increase also their insecurity after that hour. With, therefore, a force of men wholly  insufficient for the first duty they have in hand - the watching of the public streets - it is not strange that in such dark  corners as Mitre square such daring deeds of violence are done after nightfall with impunity.An excited and indignant public must have a scapegoat, and London has, by common consent, selected for a victim Sir Charles  Warren, chief commissioner of police. Much color is given to the common accusation by the fact that there was a serious  quarrel among the police after the Trafalgar square riots, and that in August last the force was generally remodeled.After being badgered by a corps of critics and men offering all sorts of suggestions, Sir Charles has consented to the use of  bloodhounds for tracking the murderer, but the methods proposed for their employment make it plain enough to an American that  the Londoners know very little about the nature of that brute.OPINIONS OF ALIENISTS.Of course all the eminent alienists have been called on for an opinion, and their concurrent statement as to what the lunatic  is capable of doing without detection is enough to frighten the London women out of their few remaining senses. They report  and cite many cases to prove that the old notions of human vampires, ghouls weir wolves and demoniacs were based on actual  facts; that in very age there have been men seized with an insane desire to slay and mutilate women, that along with this  there is often unnatural cunning in concealment and that actual cannibalism is not an unfrequent accompaniment. Dr. William  A. Hammond adds that what are called ""sexual perverts"" are practically unknown in America, but in countries where there is  less freedom, and where the relations of the sexes are not on such a natural basis, they are often met with. Perhaps the most  recent case of note is that of Sergt. Bertrand of the French army, who was arrested in Paris as a ghoul in 1847, and  convicted of digging up the corpses of women in the cemetery. The particulars of his cannibalism, published by the French  medical author, Morel, cannot even be hinted at here.TRYING THE BLOODHOUNDSSir Charles Warren Lets the dogs Chase Him as an ExperimentThe London police have engaged in what looks to Americans much like comedy, that is in ""testing"" the bloodhounds. The  correspondent of the New York Sun gives this account of it: It was barely daybreak, and the frost lay thick upon the grass,  when Warren's stalwart form showed the way to the place of trial, followed by a few experts, one holding a pair of dogs in  the leash.SIR CHARLES' ENTHUSIASM.Sir Charles, in a fit of enthusiasm, offered himself for the quarry, and started off at a good swinging trot. He was soon  lost to sight, and then different policemen crossed his track. The dogs were laid on, and worked surely but slowly along  until they arrived at the sopt where the first policeman had crossed the trail. Here the dogs were at fault for a time. but  soon took up the scent again, the 2 year-old Burgho, who won first prize in the New York dog show this year, leading off.  Burgho has been trained from a puppy to hunt the clean shoe and was well up to the work, though evidently the scent did not  lie well. Finally both dogs failed, going off on some side scent.A new trial was started. Sir Charles again acted the hunted man, taking 1,200 yards start. The dogs did well for a while, but  finally were baffled, owing to the number of people who crossed the trail. Three more courses were tried, but in only one did  the hounds succeed in catching their man, and then they licked and fondled him as an old friend.NOT ALTOGETHER UNSATISFACTORY.Considering that the dogs were following the scent of a man alone, and that the morning was extremely bad for following any  trail, the result was not altogether unsatisfactory. If the Whitechapel murderer, on the occasion of his next crime, smears  himself with blood or carries off any portion of the body, it is believed the dogs will hunt him down.Sir Charles Warren, in his tight military dress, and puffing and blowing with his exertions, did not look a very dignified  chief commissioner, but if he went back to Scotland Yard hot and tired it was certainly with the most novel feeling that he  had a made a good start with his day's work. He was very mad when the evening newspapers came out with reports of his  morning's doings, which doubtless were also read and noted by the murderer.   PROBABLY A LUNATIC.The Opinions of Experts - The Law of Atonement.Professor Ordrenaux, of Columbia College Law school, author of standard works on the legal bearings of insanity, and for nine  years state commissioner of lunacy for New York, gives this opinion:IS THE LONDON FIEND INSANE?""The murderer is a lunatic, of course. There is no doubt of that. His very cleverness in eluding the police might be a proof  of it. The devilish cunning and resource of some maniacs is marvelous. The question is, what frightful nightmare of madness  is this that possesses him? When he is caught he will speak out; he won't hesitate to give reasons as far as he is able.""Meanwhile, we can only guess. But cases of the kind have not been so rare that we need guess at random. The vampires of the  middle ages  that haunted the cemeteries and dug up the bodies of women to tear the flesh from their bones were doubtless  madmen of his caliber. They were a very real terror to their time, not at all creatures of an excited fancy. At times their  peculiar madness became fairly epidemic on the continent of Europe. The reason why the psychology of the middle ages presents  many more such cases than our day is that then they ran unhindered, while nowadays such lunatics would be very soon arrested.""Science may ridicule the idea of demoniacal possession. Those who deny that there is anything but matter will see no proof to  the contrary. Proof expires with the conditions of matter you are examining, and when you drop the subject as a mental and  take it up as a moral question you tread on uncertain ground in a sense. It is true that you cannot find a demon with a  microscope or figure it out by tables of logarithms: and yet it is not irrational to suppose that a distance evil agency does  dominate the human mind under circumstances when it is overthrown to the last degree and has lost its personal and subjective  identity. When insanity, originating in a perversion of the sexual instinct, passes beyond bounds within which it can be  explained on conditions of physical deterioration, it is permissible to recognize a superhuman cause as the controlling power  in the domination of human conduct. This is demoniacal possession. Granted that the only foundation for belief in it is the  utterly inhuman and illogical conduct of the victim, yet if he alone of ten thousand lunatics similarly affected goes this  length, we shall have to assume either that he is a being differently formed, which we cannot do, or that some new agency is  discovered in his case, as in that of this London murderer. Here is where 'possession of an evil spirit' steps in to supply  the explanation. It seems to me as admissible in this last emergency as the law of gravitation. Nobody sees it, yet nobody  doubts it. We all see its results.BLOOD ATONEMENT.""The law of blood atonement is written on the constitution of the human mind, and when utterly perverted by a sense of  intolerable wrong makes of the man such an ogre as this slayer of women. There are many kinds of vampirism, but they all  cluster around this one idea of motiveless mutilation of dead bodies. No one would do the deeds of this monster unless  dominated by the law of blood atonement mingled with an evil principle that then takes the form of demoniacal possession.""The law must furnish by punishment some motive for the man to resist. The taking possession of a mind is a gradual process,  a consequence of willful sin against nature's law, or weak yielding. The whole subject opens up such a wide field of  metaphysical study and religious suggestion that you cannot answer any question in one word, yes or mo. It is yes up to a  certain point and no beyond it.""Dr. Hammond is also emphatic in his opinion that such murderers should be executed, and alienists generally are adopting the  view that a monomaniac is often morally responsible for his condition and that the responsibility can be fixed. And, adopting  the opinion of medical men, the London police now have a theory that satisfies them and claim to have a particular individual  in view and to possess corroborative evidence in support of their theory. He has been repeatedly tracked and traced, and is a  well known and wealthy resident of Grosvenor square, the most fashionable quarter of London. A sensation of immense magnitude  is expected in connection with this matter.."
42,index/atchison_daily_globe_18881110.txt,atchison_daily_globe,1888-11-10,"Atchison Daily GlobeKansas, USA10 November 1888THE MURDER FIENDThe Whitechapel Woman Butcher Commits More Awful Tragedy Than the Preceding.London, Nov, 9.The murder fiend has added another victim to his list. At eleven o'clock this morning the body of a woman cut into pieces was discovered in a house on Dorset street, Spitalfields. The police are endeavoring to track the murderer with the aid of bloodhounds. The appearance of the remains was frightful, and the mutilation was even greater than in the previous cases. The head had been severed and placed beneath one of the limbs. The ears and nose had been cut off. The body had been disembowelled and the flesh was torn from the thighs. Several organs were missing. The skin had been torn off the forehead and cheeks. One hand had been pushed into the stomach. The victim's name is believed to have been Lizzie Fisher, but to most of the habitués of the haunts she visited she was known as Mary Jane. She had a room in the house where she was murdered. She carried a latch key and no one knows at what hour she entered the house last night, and probably no one saw the man who accompanied her. Therefore, it is hardly likely that he will ever be identified. He might easily have left the house at any time between one and six o'clock this morning without attracting attention. The doctors who have examined the remains refuse to make any statement until the inquest is held. Three bloodhounds belonging to private citizens were taken to the place where the body lay and placed on the scent of the murderer but they were unable to keep it for any great distance and all hope of running the assassin down with their assistance will have to be abandoned.The murdered woman told a companion last evening that she was without money and would commit suicide if she did not obtain a supper. It has been learned that a man respectably dressed accosted her and offered her money and they went to her lodgings, on the second floor of the Dorset street house. No noise was heard during the night and nothing was known of the murder until the landlady went to the room early this morning to ask for her rent. The first thing she saw on entering the room was the woman's breasts and viscera lying on a table.Dorset street is short and narrow and is situated close to Mitre square and Hanbury street.The opinion of Archibald Forbes and Mr. Winslow that the assassin was a homicidal maniac is confirmed by the latest murder, and the prediction has become general that another murder will soon follow."

The hopes of the police of catching the Whitechapel murderer, which had almost entirely died out, were raised to the acme of buoyancy yesterday in consequence of the testimony at the Kelly inquest of George Hutchinson, a groom, who had known the victim for several years and who saw a well dressed man with Jewish cast of countenance accost her on the street at two o'clock on the morning of the murder and the circumstances of his acquaintance induced him to follow the pair as they walked together. He looked straight into the man's face as he turned to accompany the woman and followed them to Miller (sic) court out of mere curiosity. He had no thought of the previous murders and certainly no suspicion that the man contemplated violence, since his conspicuous manifestations of affection for his companion as they walked along formed a large part of the incentive to keep them in sight. After the couple entered the house Hutchinson heard sounds of merriment in the room and remained at the entrance to the court for fully three-quarters of an hour. About three o'clock the sound ceased and he walked into the court, but finding that the light in the room had been extinguished went home. During the hour occupied in standing at the entrance to or promenading the court he did not see a policeman. There is every reason to believe Hutchinson's statement, and the police place great reliance upon his description of the man, believing it will enable them to run him down. The witness who testified previously of having seen the woman enter the house with a man with a blotched face was evidently mistaken as to the night as his description of her companion is totally unlike that of Hutchinson's in every particular. The bulk of the evidence taken fixes the time of the murder at between 3:30 and four o'clock. It transpired yesterday that in addition to the face mutilation of the murdered woman the uterus was wholly and skilfully removed and laid in a corner of the bed. "

An article published in the Daily Statesman, calling attention to the similarity of the Austin and London crimes and  especially the fact that a Malay cook running on ocean vessels was suspected, called forth a letter to the editor. The letter  stated that a Malay cook had been employed at a small hotel in Austin in 1885, the date of the Austin assassinations.A reporter investigated the matter, calling on Mrs. Schmidt, who kept the Pearl House, near the foot of Congress Avenue  opposite the Union depot, three years ago. It was ascertained that a Malay cook calling himself Maurice had been employed at  the house in 1885 and that he left some time in January 1886.It will be remembered that the last of the series of Austin women murders was the killing of Mrs. Hancock and Mrs. Eula  Phillips, the former occurring on Christmas eve 1885, just before the Malay departed, and that the series then ended.A strong presumption that the Malay was the murderer of the Austin women was created by the fact that all of them except two  or three resided in the immediate neighborhood of the Pearl House.Mrs. Hancock and her husband, lived within one block, and so did Mary Ramie, the colored girl, and others who were  assassinated in their beds and dragged out into their yards."

He Was Charged with Being the Whitechapel Fiend - Where Is He Now? Dr. Tumblety, the American who was suspected of being the Whitechapel murderer and arrested in London not long ago, but soon after released, is a man with a singular history. Between 1860 and 1864 he was as well known on the streets of Brooklyn, where he posed as an Indian herb doctor, as he subsequently was in the corridors of the Fifth Avenue hotel, where he paraded as an Englishman of wealth and a physician of marked pretensions. Oddly enough, his companion when in Brooklyn was young Herold, who was implicated in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and who formed one of the quartet that subsequently swung from the gallows tree. Tumblety, at that time, had an office on Fulton Street, where he sold herbs for removing pimples from the face. Herold - who was a pale faced, large eyed, poetical looking boy - was with Tumblety constantly. He seemed a compromise between friend, companion and servant to the doctor. Tumblety had a large following in Brooklyn at this time, but played himself out after a time, and went across the river to New York. He always amde a good living - how, aside from his quack herb business, no one could tell. He was at this time a curious looking man. He was about six feet four inches in height, and was an extremely well built though homely featured man. His face was very red, and his mustache dyed a jet black. Sometimes he rode, but generally he strode through the streets attended by a huge mastiff. He disappeared from public view after he had achieved great notoriety when he was suspected of complicity in the scheme to introduce yellow fever, by means of infected clothing, during the war, into New York city. Not long before the assassination of President Garfield he was often seen at the Fifth Avenue hotel with Charles Guiteau. Little has been heard of him of late years. He has a cunning felicity for achieving world wide notoriety by getting into apparent scrapes, but he always comes through his scrapes unscathed, unharmed. His notoriety in connection with the Whitechapel horrors is but another instance of this. A graphical copy of this article can be found here.  Our thanks to Chris Scott for finding this article."

Two were found butchered out of all recognition, even their faces being horribly slashed, and in the cases of all the others their persons were frightfully disfigured. Like Jack the Ripper's victims, they have been found in out of the way places. Two of the victims were possessed of gaudy jewelry, and from that it is urged that the mysterious murderer has not committed the crimes for robbery. In fact, in almost every detail the crimes and characteristics are identical with the Whitechapel horrors.MORE OF JACKCumberland, Md., Feb. 7.Some time ago a white girl named Greuber, aged sixteen, working in Mr. Tearney's family in this place, while the family were absent one evening, was criminally assaulted by a negro servant named Douglas, who threatened if she uttered one word he would cut her throat and use her like Jack the Ripper. She was so frightened that it was not until very recently she told her father of the negro's crime. The father sought the good offices of State Attorney Sloan, who last week had the grand jury indict the negro, but before the warrant could be issued for his arrest, Douglas, who had heard of the matter, fled from the city. The sheriff is making diligent search for the man. It was not known to the public until today, and the people are bent upon lynching the negro if he be captured.AND STILL MORENew York, Feb. 7.Fannie Moore, aged eleven, was stopped on the street January 24 while going home from school by a well dressed man who insulted her and declared that he was Jack the Ripper.

Alarming New Outbreak of Stranglers, Stabbers and ClippersConnecticut's ""Phantom Fiend"" Returns to Claim His Twenty-Third Victim, While Overseas Scotland Yard Is Ferreting Out the ""Burke of 1927""	""Jack the Ripper"" is back again!		Mothers in Bridgeport, Conn., following the twenty-third stabbing case during the past two years, are clutching at their hearts with fear and anxiety every minute that their little ones are out of their sight.		Somewhere in that city roaming the streets, eager for the blood of the innocent, is a murderous maniac, brother of Jack the Strangler, the Stabber, the Clipper-all of them names for varieties of the same type of criminal.		The ""rippers"" have written a red record of maniacal horror in many great cities of the world and are continuing to do so today. Scotland Yard officials are right now in the midst of solving such a case.		This Bridgeport fiend has, so far, manifested no desire to kill his victims, but merely to stab them and then take to flight. Those who have seen him, for he has been pursued, though ineffectually, describe him as middle-aged and of an incredible fleetness of foot. His method is to spring suddenly out of the darkness, run at top speed upon some unsuspecting girl, plunge the needle-like point of a weapon into her chest or arm or throat, and then dart away into the shadow without once slackening his flight. 		In the latest case in Bridgeport the ""Ripper"" stabbed Isabel Parker, aged sixteen, in a department store at five o'clock in the afternoon. The girl was in the store, surrounded by hundreds of shoppers and clerks, when she felt a knife plunged into her side and back. She screamed, ""I've been stabbed!"" and then fainted, and was taken to a hospital. There was a scene of wild confusion in the store; nobody actually witnessed the incident, and the ""Ripper"" escaped easily.		Twenty-three times now has this terrifying, mysterious creature unsheathed his knife in Bridgeport. Twenty-three times have young women, and sometimes mere school children, been the victims of this man's fiendish attacks, and the police are still searching in vain for him.		In consequence, a measure of mute apprehension has taken hold of the community, for scarcely a girl feels safe if she ventures abroad after nightfall, even though she be not alone.		These attacks are ominously like echoes of the notorious atrocities in the Whitechapel district of London, performed by London's famous ""Jack the Ripper,"" the first of the brutes to be so labelled. It was in this London slum district that he slew and mutilated his victims. There were seven of them, seven mounting horrors.		Blue-blooded, conservative Boston has not been exempt. She received a visit from a ""Ripper"" and Alberta Ross, an eighteen-year-old girl, was attacked in a crowded Cambridge street by a marauder, who made his escape.		New York has had more than its share of these ""ripper"" crimes, some as horrible as those of the British capital; Paris has known them, as have Berlin and Canada. Chicago and Atlanta have been the scenes of similar attacks.		Belvedere, N.J., knows the terror of the ""ripper,"" for Helen Becker, a school girl of that town, had her hair cut off by a maniac who jumped upon her from the underbrush as she was carrying milk cans.		But Bridgeport's list of victims is a record and includes many young girls. Catherine Dillon, thirteen years old is one of these. She was stabbed in the breast with a sharp instrument. Rose Kerensky gave the police a vivid description of the mysterious maniac who attacked her. Rose who is twelve years old, said she had a feeling that someone was following her several days before she was knifed.		Mary Dirgo is another of the girl victims of Bridgeport's ""phantom stabber."" She is believed by the police to have been struck with an implement resembling an ice pick. She is sixteen, but like most of the other girl victims is mature beyond her age.		Atlanta has a ""Jack the Ripper,"" all of whose victims were negro women. He worked his horrors in that city for two years and he murdered twenty of them. He was as methodical and cunning about his work as the London ""Jack"" and possessed, too, quite knowledge of anatomy.		Saturday night was the time invariably chosen for his crimes. He came upon his victims from behind and with a single stroke of a razor, supposedly, or with a surgeon's sharp knife, cut their throats.		Berlin was baffled for an entire Winter by a ""ripper."" One woman was killed by a stab wound in the abdomen, three were mortally wounded, fourteen seriously hurt, five slightly injured and eight merely scratched.		Scotland Yard is unraveling a ""strangler"" case even now. Mrs. Mary Alice Mottram, 21, wife of George Edward Mottram, miner, of Sheffield, England, was murdered by strangulation. Soon after the crime was committed the police intimated that they were anxious to interview a strange, tall, dark, middle-aged woman ""with a masculine voice"" who had been lurking in the neighborhood, and had expressed her determination to find a couple she was in search of, ""if she died in the attempt.""		Then, with dramatic suddenness, a man surprised a policeman by voluntarily giving himself into custody and making a statement in regard to the murder. Mrs. Mottram had been done to death as she sat having her tea. A book, which she had been reading, was propped up on the table, and there were also the remains of a half-eaten meal. The dead woman's husband, who had been on the afternoon shifts at the colliery, leaving home about 1:30 p.m. and returning about 10:30 p.m., made the distressing discovery immediately on entering the house.		Going into the kitchen, he saw his wife lying on her back with her head close to a table and her feet against the wall of the room. Around her throat was a towel knotted and on top of it a piece of clothes line. It had two knots in it. Everything was in its usual place and there were no signs of a struggle. The police and a doctor were called. The doctor certified that the woman had died of asphyxiation.		Mrs. Mottram, who had been married two years, had continued to work for a cutlery firm and had been so employed on the day of her murder. She had complained of late of not feeling well. She said her nerves were bad and she felt ""evil hanging over her,"" adding that she had not an enemy in the world and could not understand her feelings.		The man who surrendered to the police is Samuel Case, 24, a married miner, also of Sheffield. He trembled violently when he appeared in court charged with the murder of Mrs. Mottram.		Coincident with what the authorities take to be a new crime wave in Great Britain has come, on the part of authors, a revived interest in the dark deeds of England's past. Just as, last year, the startling series of killings in the United States was artistically reflected in Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy,"" which was a success in the theatre, so now memories of the notorious Thompson-Bywaters case have inspired an actor, Frank Vosper, to write its dramatic parallel in his play, ""Surmise,"" or ""Spellbound,"" as it was later called.		The slaying of Percy Thompson, morose husband of pretty Edith Thompson, by her 20-year-old lover, Freddie Bywaters is a murder classic. Mrs. Thompson and her sulky mate were returning from the theatre one night when Bywaters, a roving sailor, set upon the man and fatally knifed him. The Lord Chamberlain forbade the production of the play in London, but it was done in the United States with the eminent actress, Pauline Lord, in the central role, and succeeded in further stirring up interest in the international crime waves of yesterday and today.		Few ""rippers"" have been caught, but those that have, like all vainglorious evildoers, are found to be boastful of their acts. William Hannaford, eighteen years old, arrested in Boston during an epidemic of such horrors in that city, proudly asserted that he had attacked six girls in one week without being caught. He declared that the attacks were made because of ""an irresistible impulse.""		It is a sad list, this category of curious crimes, whose perpetrations, in the greater number of cases, have gone unpunished and it offers endless food for reflection. As one glances over the series of unsolved crimes, which extend back for a period of years one finds there deeds of horror that have spread over the land from the Atlantic to the Pacific and which also have been perpetrated equally as brutally in the countries across the sea.		The deeds of the ""rippers"" stand out strongly because they resemble each other to great degree, through varying the techniques of execution.		Medical science explains that ""Jack the Ripper,"" ""Jack the Strangler,"" ""Jack the Stabber,"" ""Jack the Clipper"" is a person who is always mentally deficient. Though he may appear in all respects normal, except when he is seized with the uncontrollable desire to commit an attack, he is nevertheless mentally unbalanced. It is a type of mental derangement that spasmodically occurs and numerous cases are on record of men of intellect and even genius who were seized by a desire, long slumbering in the unconscious mind, to commit such a depredation.		In many instances it is a case of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" for the ""ripper"" may be a man of culture, possibly the father of a family whose children are the example of good behavior, but who from time to time has the terrible urge to see people suffer. Not often, scientists state, do these men attack their own. Education and age make little difference, for ""rippers"" of all ages and classes have been known.		Deeds of ""Jack the Rippers"" recorded in criminal history have been bloodier than the mere ""cave man"" attacks of today. The darkest traditions of Scotland Yard have to do with the heinous Whitechapel murders by ""Jack the Ripper,"" who ran at large many years ago. A whole literature of stories grew out of the Whitechapel killings, now revived in the vicious and vigorous outbreak of clippings, stabbings and rippings on both sides of the Atlantic, which, it almost seems, is practically the only place these masters do not choose for their playground.

Not only have the head and arms been separated from the body, but the abdomen has been cut vertically and the viscera exposed, as in the other cases. The sanguinary monster evidently had more time, and was able to perform his terrible task with greater leisure. With reference to the severed arm which is missing, it will be remembered that about a month ago a woman's arm was found floating in the Thames at Pimlico. It has been preserved, and will be compared with the remains.THE MONSTER'S PREVIOUS CRIMES.""The Knifer"" began his horrible work on Whitmonday. Six of his seven victims have been killed in the neighborhood of Whitechapel. Since it seems to be his intention to murder as many abandoned women as possible, his choice of Whitechapel as a hunting ground is a good one. It abounds in the most degraded specimens of the feminine sex, and it is one mass of dark, reeking purlieus that look as they were designed by some friend of the highwayman or accomplice of the assassin.The first woman was stabbed in thirty-nine places. Those who saw the body said that the murderer must have hacked at it with devilish delight.Nine weeks ago the second woman fell like a prey to the maniac. She was butchered like a sheep being ripped entirely open.Victim No. 3 was brutally carved. Portions of the body had been removed. She, like her sisters, went to her Maker fresh from a life of sin.What horrible torments had the madman inflicted on these women before dispatching them like cattle? Possibly he had subjected them to awful tortures, and feasted on their groans until the approach of some one made him, in self-defense give them the finishing blow.The fourth unfortunate was killed on September 8th in a backyard in Hambury (sic) street. The throat was cut and the head hung on by a piece of the vertebrae which had not been severed. The abdomen was ripped up and its contents made a fantasic decoration round the face of the corpse. It was the work of a butcher without doubt, or of a doctor practiced in carving the human cadaver.It was said that the madman wrote in blood on the wall: ""Fifteen more before I surrender.""The fifth sacrifice was made at Gateshead, near Newcastle-on-Tyne, on September 23. The circumstances were almost exactly the same as those attending the four previous murders.The sixth and seventh victims were killed this week in a similar manner.Inspector Byrnes on the London MurdersAmericans, with their prompt methods and their contempt for red tape, cannot understand the horrible murder of so many women in the Whitechapel district of London.Inspector Byrnes, the famous New York detective, is worried over the inefficiency of the London police. He believes that one man committed all the Whitechapel murders, and he thinks that he is a man of superior intelligence who is acting under the influence of a homicidal mania. The inspector says that the localization of the crimes and the fact that the victims all belong to the same class of women ought to make it easy to discover the criminal. His plan would be to manufacture victims for the murderer. That is, he would tempt him by scattering say fifty women over the Whitechapel district, with a large force of disguised policemen at convenient points where they could see everything. In this way it is almost certain that the monster would be caught.The inspector says that such a series of crimes could not happen in New York or any other American city. By the time the second or third murder was committed the people would be in a fever of excitement and the police would be forced by public opinion to solve the mystery, or at least check the epidemic of slaughter.It will strike most people that the New York detective's plan is a good one, but perhaps he is mistaken when he says that so many murders, all of the same class, could not occur in an American city. How about Austin, Texas? About two years ago more than half a dozen women were mysteriously murdered in that town, preumably by the same man, and from that day to this the criminal has remained undiscovered."

Hammond, the insanity expert of this city, says the Whitechapel murders are committed by a homicidal maniac who is like a tiger in his nature. If caught, the law should shield its eyes while society hangs the maniac. Continuing, the doctor said:""Cases of homicidal insanity are very common. They are confined to no class or country, and the books are full of them. The last instance of this kind in New York that I recall was that man, I have forgotten his name, who ran through Fourteenth street with a carpenter's compass in his hand, stabbing every woman he met. I examined him and found it a plain case of homicidal insanity.""""Are people affected in this way particularly noticeable?""""Now, that's just the mistake the London police are making,"" replied the doctor, sharply, ""they are looking for a repulsive, uncouth butcher, dripping with blood and hiding in the cellars about Whitechapel. In society he is probably a mild-mannered man. He may move in the very best circles. He may be known among his acquaintances for his modesty, his refinement, his humanity. He may even have an effeminate horror of bloodshed and strife. And yet, for some one of a dozen causes - disease, drink or what-not - he may have, at times, this insatiable desire for blood. My own opinion is,"" continued the doctor, ""that he is actuated by some fanatical religious ideas. He thinks that he is doing religion a service in ridding the world of such women as he kills, for in every case they are reported as being prostitutes. The appetite increases with indulgence. This Whitechapel lunatic thinks now that he is doing a service in killing ignorant, depraved women. Presently it will occur to him to kill women whom he thinks belong to the same class, but who are in high life, and it would not at all surprise me if the next victim was a duchess or a countess. Then he will be caught.""""What are the symptoms of homicidal insanity?""""They are different in different cases. Usually the disease is accompanied by inability to sleep, rush of blood to the head, dizziness, confusion of ideas, and then delusion.""""The fact of an American offering hundreds of dollars for anatomical specimens is absurd, is it not?""""To the last degree. I see the coroner dwelt on it in charging the jury. The specimens referred to can be purchased in this city in unlimited quantities for $1.""    Theories of a Chicago Medical manChicago, October 4.Dr. J. G. Kiernan, of this city, a recognized medical authority and editor of the Medical Standard, said today that the Whitechapel murderer is a cannibal pure and simple. The doctor added: ""The Whitechapel murders are clearly the work of a lunatic of the so called ""sexual pervert"" type, fortunately rare in Anglo-Saxon lands but not infrequently met with in Russia, Germany, Bohemia and France. In these lunatics there is a return to the animal passions of the lowest cannibalistic savage races. Cannibalism is shown in a thirst for blood, and these animal passions come to the surface when the checks imposed by centuries of civilization are removed either by disease or by the defects inherited from degenerate parents. The most noted of these cases was that of Giles De Retz, the original Bluebeard, of the reign of Louis XV, who slaughtered two hundred female children in the same way as the Whitechapel butcher. The mutilations were very similar. A number of similar cases are on record in which the murderer devoured the mutilated parts. It was only a few years ago, in 1883, that all Westphalia, in Germany, was roused by several mysterious murders of females of the same type as those of Whitechapel. The vampirism of the middle ages, extending down through the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and early eighteenth century was a phase of this form of insanity.""""As to the remedy,"" continued Dr. Kiernan, ""shut up the harmless, logical lunatics and release fewer so-called 'sane' men by legal procedures from state insane hospitals, and crimes of all kinds by the insane will cease. No lunatic should be at large unless some reliable person is pecuniarily responsible for his acts. The 'philanthropists' who release 'sane' people from the insane hospitals always decline pecuniary responsibility. There are lunatics now at large in Chicago, released as sane from insane hospitals, who, under certain conditions, are fully capable of committing Whitechapel murders."""

[Special]So intense is the feeling among all classes in London in regard to the bloody horrors, committed with impunity in Whitechapel, that it is not surprising to hear of so prominent a member of parliament as Colonel J. C. Hughes-Hallett, of her majesty's service, turning detective and visiting in disguise the perilous (sic) of the east end of the world's metropolis, with the deliberate intention of meeting, and if possible, apprehending the murderous monomaniac whose crimes have made the civilized world stand aghast.HUGHES-HALLETT'S STORY.Colonel Hughes-Hallett, who is staying at the Breevort during his present visit to New York, gave a World reporter yesterday a thrilling account of his midnight visit to the scene of the monster's carnival of crime, made just after the commission of the second atrocity in that gory series which has drawn all eyes to the East End of London. Said Colonel Hallett:""You may remember that the second of the mutilated bodies discovered in Whitechapel was that of Martha Turner, a hawker, which was found on the second floor landing of the George Yard buildings in Commercial Street, Spitalfield. The similarity of the mutilation, the identity of the district and of the woman's occupation with those of the first victim, convinced me that I had to deal with a case of homicidal mania. I chose a bright, moonlight night for my expedition to Whitechapel, just the kind of night that the thug whom I wanted to trail had a predilection for. I had already a theory of my own about the kind of man the assassin would turn out to be. I had more upon my mind, and I have seen since no reason to change it, that the perpetrator of these atrocities is a West End man, a gentleman, a person of wealth and culture perhaps, but certainly of intellectual qualities, finesse and keen discrimination.His motive? Well, we will come to that presently. I was convinced that my man left his club, as I was then doing, and disguised himself for his hideous nocturnal revel as I was about to do.So I drove to my apartment and, doffing my evening dress, got into a plain, quiet pair of trousers [illegible] a rough [illegible] coat and a pot hat. I took plenty of money [illegible] but no jewelry of any kind [illegible] gave the driver orders to drive to [illegible] street.The man turned and looked at me in such a peculiar way that I am sure he suspected me. [illegible] had already been raised over town, for the second crime, by its singular atrocity, sent a chill of horror down every spine, and the police had given orders to the cabmen to watch suspicious 'fares'. The man said nothing, however, and i pretended not to notice his scrutiny. As we drove along St. James' park, I passed a very dear old friend and fellow clubman and looked him straight in the eye. He didn't know me, for being an amateur actor as well as a detective, I had 'made up' my face and completed the disguise effectually. The reason, or perhaps the main reason why I was convinced the murderer was a West End man, was the knowledge he had shown of surgery, or rather of anatomy; the thoroughness with which he did what he set out to do, and the finesse with which he instantly effaced himself and all tell-tale signs of his fearful work.I revolved these thoughts in my mind as I drove past Cambridge music hall into Commercial road, and I felt in my pocket to see that the revolver I had put there was ready for use. In the light of all the latter developments I have seen no cause for changing this opinion. I had now arrived as near the scene of action as I felt safe to go in a cab. Midnight had struck, and the air was quiet and cool. I dismissed my cabby, looking him straight in the eye as I gave him my fare, and turned out of Commercial road into Whitechapel. The approaches to the scene of the maniac's operations are not particularly dirty, or filthy, or tumbledown, or, indeed, in any way calculated to attract unusual attention. But over them that night, and ever since, hung a brooding expectancy, a mysterious suggestion of something fearsome to be that could not fail to impress the most callous observer. As I walked from Whitechapel into Hanbury street, intending, by a round about route through the short streets and alleys connecting Commercial road and Hanbury street, to debouche into the latter, and thence into Commercial street, where the last victim had been found.I was struck with the fact that the unfortunate women who frequent that district in swarms were, as I approached the scene of the tragedy, becoming rarer and rarer. I heard none of them singing or shouting their maudling endearments, or exhibiting, in the friskiness of their behavior, the reckless glee which is so repulsive in them. The sidewalks there, as in London generally, were in good order, and cleanly kept. In your slums here, or in a corresponding quarter of New York, you would find your gutters full of filthy water and refuse, and sidewalks unflagged, perhaps, or torn up, littered with dirt and shavings. I found nothing of this sort there. The houses on either side of those short streets are two and three stories high, brick dwellings, used below as shops. There are no porches in front of them, and no distinguishing marks of architecture about them. The pavements are of brick, of course, and in good order. The gas lamps were burning bright. and there was no evidence of the ramshackle and tumble-down lanes and alleys and culs de sac which one might suppose such a thug would choose for the scene of his operations.In the smaller streets between Hanbury and Whitechapel streets the gas lamps are, of course, not so near together. We do not plant them in London as you do here, with reference to the corners of the streets. At home they are regularly placed at certain intervals, whether at the intersection of streets or not, and just before reaching George's Yard I saw what brought more forcibly than before to my mind the thrill of terror which pervaded the neighborhood. At the next corner, a stone's throw from where ""Emma"" met her fate, stood a boby (sic), a policeman, you know, looking away from me. There were several women on the opposite side of the street, and a group of men. Another policeman was just in the act of approaching them to move on, when, just in front of me, I heard a long drawn shivering sigh, an agonized catching of the breath, such as denots (sic) invariably mental agony or an extremity of terror. An unfortunate woman, not twenty feet away, was standing in the bright lamp light, reeling as if in the act of fainting. By a peculiar defect or blur in the lamp, her shadow was projected in a dead wall just to her right, with a misshapen distinctness which, in the unsettled condition of her nerves, was too much for her. She gave an awful shriek, and fell fainting to the ground. The police and passers (?) rushed up at once, and when she came to and told of the horrible shape she had seen at her elbow, congratulated her on her narrow escape from the fate which had befallen her sister in George's Yard. She was hurried away and the search for the thug continued.Just here I may say I would gladly give up my seat in parliament to become the head of the criminal investigation department in London, which never needed a head worse than now. Our police officers and detectives are subordinated to the same authority where they should be separate and independent. A detective is born, not made by uniform, clubs, orders and a star on his breast. A detective may be a gentleman and should be a man of brains, culture and literary acquaintance. A policeman need only be obedient, string and brave. He may be, and after all, is densely stupid.So short is the distance from Club Land to the dens of the East End, that I had not been out on my expedition more than three quarters of an hour now, and I was already at the door of the house where the latest disemboweled and murdered woman had been found. There was not a soul in sight save a policeman a block away, watching the doorway as if he expected to see the fiend come out, hoofs, horns and all. I crossed the street to him, and after a great deal of persuasion he described the appearance of the latest victim, where she was found a few hours before, bleeding like an abattoir, and sliced to suit the murderer's purpose with anatomical accuracy.This brings one to my theory of who the thug is. I believe him to be an army doctor retired, perhaps, or a medical student, or a gentleman who has read medicine as amusement, or as a part of a liberal education. He is a man of the world, a gentleman, a club man, perhaps, who pursues his customary action during the day, and at night sallies out with his knife and dagger to feast a homicidal mania bred in him by disease, most likely contracted from some of the unfortunate women to whom he confines his horrible revenge. By the organs he has cut out and carried away, he proves himself a sexual pervert, that is the victim of a brain bias superinduced by the disease alluded to, and driving him to frenzy at stated intervals.He should be detected by his disposition of these organs. He may have burned them, but he has probably preserved them in his apartments to gloat over. While he will, no doubt, return to the same locality with each recurring frenzy to glut his revenge, he may never be caught there. I satisfied myself that it was no use to look for him there. He must be found at his home, in his club, in the fashionable thoroughfares of the West End. When these mutilated organs are found he will not be far away.""JOHN PAUL BOCOCK A WHITE ELEPHANTWHICH COULD NOT BE FOUND IN A TEN ACRE FIELDAn Atlanta Man Who Is Crazy to Catch the Whitechapel Murderer - His New Theory and New Plan.""The London police force, the devil! Why, gentlemen, they could not find a white elephant in the middle of a ten acre field with an electric light!""This vivid exclamation trembled upon the drum of the detective reporter's ears as he meandered around Beermann's corner yesterday.He stopped and turned.The word were shot with explosive utterance from the lips of a womanish-looking man whose very being seemed a flame with intense emotion.His face blushed. His small black eyes glittered. His white hands made zigzag gestures. His trim-buil, neatly-clad form quivered with excitement. His thin lips were cherry and purple in turn as he spoke, and the pale throat and his high, smooth and ashen brow presented a peculiar contrast to the regular girlish features and plump cheeks now reddened with passion.His voice was shrill and high, and he showed his white teeth like Carker in the tale.He talked on.""I am sick of this balderdash about police detectives. Why, I pick up the papers every day and within the past two weeks I have read of half a dozen murders committed right here in Atlanta - and only one of the murderers apprehended. Great Heavens! what a showing. But these things don't interest me. I go in for Bigger game.I was born with the detective fever, and at the age of thirty I am still shaking with it, and this Whitechapel bloody work has made me almost wild. I read about it, I think about it, I dream about it, and to save me I can't talk ten minutes without talking about it.You will excuse my warmth, gentlemen, but the eyes of the world are turned upon the slums of Whitechapel, London, and damn me if I don't believe I can catch the inhuman monster who is bathing his hands in the innocent blood of these poor, helpless women.Why, just to think of it! He murdered one the other day just a few moments after a policeman had passed by; and the London dispatches say today that his last frail victim was horribly mangled and left within two blocks of Scotland Yard, which, we are told, turns out the best detectives on earth. He did this to dare the detectives in their den - but they won't even take a dare, ha!, ha! What a travesty, this, on armed authority. One murderer more than a match for whole platoons of so-called skilled detectives and the combined police power of the greatest city in the world!""As he said this his sneer was a study in contempt.""Why don't you go to London and try your hand?""""Simply because I am not able to have my business. But if the people of Atlanta will make up a purse, I will go, and, as I said before, I firmly believe that the plan of action, now in my mind, could be worked to a successful issue.""""It would be a big thing for Atlanta if you should go over and catch the Whitechapel murderer. It would make you a perfect hero,"" said an interested listener.""Yes,"" remarked another, ""and I believe if the women of Atlanta really thought that you could capture the monster they would raise the money to send you over. Women are more sympathetic than men, and all over this town they are taking a horrible interest in the butchering of females by this fiend incarnate.""""Something tells me that I can do the work,"" continued the first speaker calmly, ""but it would be necessary for me to have at least a month's time. Would you like to hear my theory on these murders and my plan of catching the murderer?""The crowd said that they were all attention.""Well, my theory, gentlemen, is that the murderer is a woman-hater - a genuine woman-hater. I think that he has been treated cruelly by some woman whom he loved better than his left, and that he has sworn vengeance against the sex. He makes war to the knife on women, but his cunning hand is guided by a shrewd head. The times and places of his terrible work all show this to be true. I believe that he is a man fo means and perfectly sane, otherwise how could he jump from Texas to London as he has done. If he had been a lunatic he would have been caught long ago. No, sir, he is a cool reasoner. Why does he kill poor helpless abandoned women. For the best reason in the world. He knows that the world takes little interest in outcasts. Therefore his chances to escape detection are better. Suppose he should kill a society belle or a famous actress? Aha! The risk would be too great, and he knows it. Organized effort would be made to capture him and might succeed. So he picks his women - women that he knws the world thinks are better off dead - women without place or power or money or friends or homes - women over whose mutilated remains no tears will fall - women with no fathers, brothers, husbands, sons to protect or care for them. But this gluts his vengenace against the sex just the same.He is not a lady-killer - he's simply a woman butcher. That's my theory.Now for my plan of action. If I had the money I would go to London, and take lodgings in the toughest part of Whitechapel, in the immediate vicinity of these murders. I would pick out on the most heaven-forsaken of the women who live there and buy from her the clothes which she ordinarily wears. I understand the art of 'make up.' I would put on these clothes, make up my face to suit - in short, thoroughly disguise myself as one of these women and walk from dark till daylight about that vice hardened locality. I would go alone, and keep a keen lookout. You observe he kills women only when they are alone - not when they are walking around with people. When he tackled me, and I believe I could fool him into doing it, I would be too quick for him - that's all. I would hack him to pieces with a long, keen knife which I would carry concealed in the folds of my dress.""""But the nerve and the patience - have you got them to do it?"" asked a gentleman.""I have. And I tell you the solemn truth when I say that nothing in life would give me greater delight than to undertake the job. I would rather catch or kill that murderer of helpless women than to have one million dollars - and I am willing to go into a notary this minute and make affidavit to it.""With these words the young, womanish-looking man smiled and bowed to the crowd, and walked hurriedly down the street.They all know him - and all believed everything that he had said.That Whitechapel MurdererHe is the greatest criminal in the world today, and possibly the greatest the world has ever known.But who is he?That is the question which the whole civilized world is asking.Is he a common thug, with a homicidal mania, who sneaks from his hiding place at night to commit his horrible crimes?Is he some medical student, some retired army or navy doctor, some person who has studied medicine and is now endeavoring to prove some pet theory or other, and takes this altogether horrible way of doing it?Is he some crank, wrapped up in the belief that it is his mission to rid the world of the worthless women whose lives he has taken?Is he the loathsome, fiendish Mr. Hyde of some highly respectable Dr. Jekyll - some man, as Sir Hughes-Hallett suggests, who moves in society, a club man, perhaps, and highly respected, where only the better part of his dual life is known?He might be any one of these. There are only two things certain about this sensational affair - that the crimes are the most horrible the world has known, and that the London police has proved itself incapable of grasping the situation. The murderer and his murders form the sole topic of conversation everywhere.But who is he?"

That some good may thus come out of this horribly ghoulish affair is possible, as out of all other horrors and evils. Civilization is enduring a phase of barbarism in tolerating this public advertisement of shame, but so far has been unable to permanently check it or to prevent it. It is more than probable that when the fiend or fiends are discovered they will be found to be of the class that has become maniacal and irresponsible by vulgar abuse and shameless habits.

Details of this tragedy are even more revolting than the six which preceded it. Accurate circumstances of the affair are hard to discover, the police, as usual, placing every obstacle in the way of investigation by reporters but all reports go to prove that the murder is far surpassing inFIENDISH ATROCITYall the terrible crimes with which the east end of London has been familiarized within the past six months. The woman, twenty six years old, Mary Jane Kelly by name, had lived four months in a front room on the second floor of a house up an alley known as Cartin's Court. This poor woman was in service a short time ago, but since she came to reside in the court had been recognized by her neighbors as a person who, like so many unfortunate members of her sex within the eastern end of the town, managed to live a wretched existence by the practice of immorality under the most degrading conditions.The court faces a small square with a narrow entrance and surrounded by squalid lodging houses let to women of this unfortunate class. Mary Kelly is described as a tall woman, not bad looking, dark complexioned, and she generally wore an old black velvet jacket. She was wearing this jacket this morning, when about quarter past eight she went down the court, jug in hand, and returned shortly afterward with milk for breakfast. She was next seen about ten o'clock, when she went to a neighboring beer house and stayed drinking for half an hour. This wasTHE LAST SEEN OF HER ALIVE.The woman was behind in her rent, and had been told by her landlord that she would be put out if she did not pay today. She went on the streets last night to earn money to pay the rent, and it seems to be clearly established that she returned to her room with a man who passed the night with her. No one has been found who saw the man go in, but some neighbors heard him talking to Mary Kelly in the room, and heard her singing as though drunk. At eleven o'clock this morning a man named Bowyer, agent of the landlord, went to Kelley's (sic) room to collect the rent. When he knocked at the door he received no answer. Removing the curtain drawn across the window of the room and looking through the broken pane, he saw the woman lying on the bed on her back, stark naked, while marks of blood were all over the place. He tried the handle of the door and found it locked, while the key had been removed from the lock. Without going into the room, Bowyer called the police, who promptly proceeded toCONCEAL ALL THE FACTS IN THE CASE.In less than two hours the doctors had the body in the morgue, and were probing it precisely as they did the Mitre square victim. They refused to give any details of the examination, but one of the physicians who was present said that he had passed much of his life in dissecting rooms, but never saw such a horrible spectacle as this murdered woman.The man who was called in to identify the body gives the following description, which seems to be reliable: The head was nearly severed from the shoulders and the face was lacerated almost beyond recognition. The breasts were both cut off and placed on the table. The heart and liver were between the woman's legs. The uterus was missing. There seemed to be at least forty cuts on the body, and bog pieces of flesh were literally stripped off and strewed on the floor. There were no indications in this case of a hand skilled in the use of a knife.THE BODY WAS LITERALLY HACKED TO PIECESbut there is no doubt at all that it was the work of the person who has become known throughout the world as the Whitechapel murderer. Mystery in this case is as deep as in the preceding crimes. The fiend got away without leaving the slightest clew.He chose his time well. At the moment which Bowyer discovered the murdered body, that gorgeous annual nuisance, which goes by the name of the lord mayor's show, was blocking the traffic of the great city for hours, and was organizing near the Mansion house. Scarcely a mile away nearly three million people were packed in the streets between the Mansion house and the Enquirer office in Trafalgar square, with nearly every policeman in the city braced as a barricade along the curb to keep them in order. The rigid police patrol maintained in Whitechapel since the last double murder in October was relaxed for one day, and in that day the assassin struck down another victim.It is scarcely necessary to say much about Kelly. She was a married woman who fell into dissolute ways, and was deserted by her husband. She had a boy eleven years old, who was begging on the streets while his mother was being murdered. The woman had as a paramour a man who sells oranges on the streets, and on whom, as he could not be found, suspicion at once reverted, but he turned up all right tonight and fainted when he was shown the body.Like the sand that slowly filter through an hour glass when reversed, the great throng in the streets who had been cheering the new lord mayor found their way into Whitechapel when the news of the murder was spread about. Every heart was filled with horror. When was this going to end? How long was this fiend in human form going to carve people to pieces under the noses of the police and mock their feeble efforts to catch him? The London police are not allowed to club a crowd into submission as the New York police are, unless in absolute riot, but the INDIGNATION AND EXCITEMENTwas so great in Whitechapel today that it was necessary for them to use harsh measures.Profiting by previous blunders the police called a photographer to take a picture of the room before the body was removed from it. This gives rise to reports that there is more handwriting on the wall, though three or four people who were allowed into the room say they did not observe it; but possibly they were too excited to notice such a detail.A young woman who knew the murdered woman well says that about ten o'clock last night she met her and that she said she had no money and could not get any. She would never go out any more, but would do away with herself. Soon after they parted, and a man, who is described as respectably dressed, came by and spoke to the murdered woman and offered her money. The man then accompanied her to her lodgings Her little boy was removed from the room and taken to a neighbor's house. The boy has been found and corroborates this but says he does not remember the man's face.Another curious circumstance worth mentioning is that the murder was not made public until twelve o'clock.Mrs. Paumier, who seems to be a creditable person, sells walnuts in Sandy's Row, near to the scene of the murder. She states that at eleven o'clock today a respectably dressed man, carrying a black bag, cam up to her and beganTALKING ABOUT THE MURDER.He appeared to know everything about it. He did not buy any walnuts, and, after standing a few, went away. Mrs. Paumier describes him as a man about thirty years old and five feet six inches in height. He wore speckled trousers and a black coat. Several girls in the neighborhood say the same man accosted them and they chaffed him. When they asked him what he had in the black bag he said: ""Something the ladies don't like."" That is all that is known. If the police have further information they carefully conceal it, but there is no reason to believe that they have."

The chief, under the circumstances, could not have done a better thing. He has been tried and found wanting. In a crowded district, in a city of nearly six million people, an unknown wretch has been permitted to murder nearly half a score of women and make his escape, leaving no trace behind him.Victim after victim fell under the knife of the mysterious assassin, but the police made no discoveries, and the chief from first to last displayed utter incompetency. He did not suggest the offering of a large reward, and he resorted to no extraordinary devices to draw the murderer into a trap. All that the chief could think of was bloodhounds. He secured a pack of dogs from a private kennel and sent them out on their hopeless mission. It resulted in a dismal failure. In crowded London a bloodhound could not follow the trail of his own master. It was an easy matter for the Whitechapel fiend to throw the dogs off the scent. All that he had to do was to change his shoes, take a cab, travel on the underground railroad, or enter a boat on the Thames.Sir Charles should have profited by a former experiment in England. Bloodhounds were used to track two desperate criminals. The fugutives quarreled in their flight, and one killed the other. When the men in pursuit found the dogs they were all collected around the body of the dead man - they had failed to follow the living criminal.No doubt Sir Charles has keenly felt the harsh judgement passed upon him by the public, but he deserved it. Does anybody suppose that a man would be able to murder eight or nine women in a single district in one of our American cities in the course of a few weeks without being caught? Our police would be everywhere, dressed in plain clothes, and women of the class selected by the murderer for his slughterhouse work, would be engaged to act as decoys, shadowed, of course, by the police. An immense reward would of course be offered.The London chief apparently sat down and waited for the Whitechapel monster to come in voluntarily and give himself up. There is a gleam of hope in the news that he has tendered his resignation, but he should have resigned long ago. Will another incompetent be appointed to succeed him?"

November 22. - (Special) H.L. Reeves, a detective of Scotland Yard, is in this city.  Speaking of the Whitechapel murder, he said it is a little surpising that the force of detectives so skilled as those of Scotland Yard have not succeeded in capturing the murderer.  The failure is no doubt due to the methods used in discovering criminals.  In New York Inspector Byrnes has every professional law breaker ""tabled,"" that is, he knows who and where he is.  When a crime has been committed he is able to point to the probable guilty party.  This system is entirely lacking in the London force, and the detectives have to cover the entire criminal field in the search.  If it were a conspiracy the English detectives would be in clover.  In the case of political conspiracy, for instance, they would become members themselves, and find a member who would peach on his fellows for money, for it has been the boast of England that when she wanted an Irish crime or political offender punished she would always do it by having an Irishman to become an informer.  But when it is a case of one cool, calculating fellow, of whose secret nobody is possessed, England and her detectives are at sea."

Who knows that he had not already reached that number, or even exceeded it?The police, under the direction of Sir Charles Warren, were baffled in their efforts to run down the murderer until, through sheer discomfiture, the chief commissioner resigned his office. The press and the public criticised the action or inaction of the police unreservedly, and in doing so unquestionably impaired their efficiency by making it apparent that failure at whatever cost of effort would be condemned, while success would go unrewarded by even appreciation or acknowledgement of the difficulties encountered in its achievement.The question is now asked, and with good reason, hasn't Jack the Ripper exceeded the number of murders to which he limited himself in his shutter proclamation and his communication to the Central News? The police under the ban of public censure for inefficiency certainly can have had no incentive to make public the details of additional murders while unable to capture the murderer since every fresh butchery has brought upon their heads further maledictions from tongue and pen.It is therefore suggested, and by many person assumed, that other bodies than the ones reported as having been deprived of life by the terrible Jack have been found by the police and quietly put out of the way, while still others have been reported as having met death by natural causes, and all means of discovering the statements removed or rendered so difficult as to restrain the curious from making one of them.It will require the exercise of all of Commissioner Monro's recognized abilities to their full extent to allay this suspicion, and that result can only be accomplished by the prompt capture of the murderer and submission to the public of evidence that the actual number of his butcheries are no greater than the official reports have represented."

The body was mutilated. The chest was so small that the murderer had been compelled to squeeze the body into it. The husband of the woman has been arrested on suspicion of being her murderer.It was positively ascertained that Wm. H. Bury, the victim, murdered her. Bury was a resident of Whitechapel, London, and his antecedents suggest that he is probably Jack the Ripper, and that he is subject to fits of unconscious murder mania. The post mortem examination held on the body proved that the woman had first been strangled, and that her body had then been mutilated, the abdomen being ripped open and the legs and arms twisted and broken.Bury says that he left Whitechapel three weeks ago. He refuses to say why he left there, and acknowledges that he had no business requiring his attention at Dundee. He says that he and his wife drank heavily last night before retiring, and that he does not know how he got to bed. Upon awakening, he says he found his wife lying upon the floor with a rope round her neck. Actuated by a sudden mad impulse, for which he cannot account, he seized a knife and slashed the body. Upon reason returning he became alarmed and hastily crushed the body into the chest in which it was found, thinking to make his escape. He found, however, that he could not leave his wifes remains, and he finally resolved to inform the police.The theory of the police officials is that Bury's wife knew of facts connecting him with the East end atrocities, and that she took him to Dundee in the hope of preventing a recurrence of the crimes."

Michael Maybrick, the brother of the deceased, testified that he had visited his brother during his illness, and had warned Mrs. Maybrick that he suspected his brother was receiving improper treatment. The wife insisted upon her right to nurse her husband. Witness thereupon summoned two doctors and a new nurse. He also seized a bottle containing brandy and an extract of meat. At a later visit witness found Mrs. Maybrick changing the contents and labels of the medicine bottles. He remonstrated with her and asked her how she dare to do such a thing. She replied that there was a sediment in the bottle. Witness again caused a change of nurse to be made. Notwithstanding his precautions, however, his brother grew worse and died in a short time. He was delirious towards the end. After his death the nurse gave witness a parcel labelled""ARSENIC POISON FOR CATS.""It contained several bottles in which was white fluid and from which the labels had been erased. Witness placed the bottles under seal and gave them to the police.Alice Japp, the nurse who had charge of Maybrick's children, was next examined. She produced a letter which was addressed to a man named Brierly, in Liverpool, and which was given to the witness by Mrs. Maybrick, the prisoner. While on her way to do this, witness dropped the letter in the mud. The envelope was soiled, and witness opened the letter with the intention of placing it in another envelope. In doing this she noticed that the letter contained a number of endearing words. The following sentences particularly attracted her attention:Dearest, husband is sick unto death. All depends upon how long his strength can hold out. Darling, relieve your mind of all fear of discovery, now or in the future. In any case, do not leave England till I see you once again.""Witness, instead of posting letterGAVE IT TO EDWIN MAYBRICK.After Maybrick died, witness found in the linen closet a box rolled up in a sheet.

On one occasion, deceased reproached his wife, saying: ""How could you do it?"" Other witnesses testified to the wife's hatred of deceased, and to her threatening to give it to him hot for publicly upbraiding her."

The nursemaid read the letter and concluded not to mail it. The letter was written with a pencil and was addressed to A. Brierly, Esq., Huskisson street, Liverpool.The letter was written by Florence Elizabeth Maybrick, wife of James Maybrick, a rich cotton merchant of Liverpool. Within a few hours after the nursemaid opened the note Maybrick was a dead man. The girl gave the letter to Edwin Maybrick, a brother of James, who allowed the funeral to go on without arousing suspicion, but he watched the widow closely and consulted with the police. This was three weeks ago.Ten days ago, while Mrs. Maybrick was ill in bed, professing to be prostrated by her husband's death, the police made her a prisoner and removed her to the hospital ward of Waltham jail. She was not told of the intention to charge her with murder, but that she simply was required as a witness to clear up the suspicious nature of her husband's death. When it became known that Mrs. Maybrick was actually charged with poisoning her husband, the evidence on which the charge was based seemed so flimsy and purely circumstantial that her neighbors felt indignant against the police and the relatives of the dead man for taking so harsh a course. But the detectives knew their ground, and the evidence against the accused woman at the coroner's inquest will shock the entire country.When Mrs. Maybrick was thought strong enough to be brought to court to hear the charge against her, but when she was told by her lawyer that she actually had to answer to a charge of murder she became prostrated again and was unable to leave the prison. Her trial was adjourned until Monday, but the coroner refused to longer postpone the inquest, which was set for today.Mrs. Maybrick is the daughter of a banker named Chandler, who lived in Mobile, Ala., at the time of the late war. After Mr. Chandler died, his widow married Baron Von Rogne, who was an officer in the German army and for some time on the personal staff of the late Emperor Frederick, when he was Crown Prince. Mrs. Von Rogne lived for some time in Paris eight years ago. While coming from America with her daughter, then 18 years old, they met James Maybrick, at the time a man over 40 years old, and doing a large business in cotton at Liverpool. Maybrick fell in love with Florence, and after their arrival in England followed her to London. They were married at once in St. James' church, Piccadilly. The bride was then described as from Norfolk, Virginia. Mrs. Maybrick had a separate fortune of about $6,000 a year left by her father. Her husband owned a fine residence, Battlecrease House, Grassendale, a suburb of Liverpool. They went there to live, and two children were the fruit of the marriage, who, since their mother's arrest, have been placed in charge of their godmother.Mr. Maybrick had two brothers, one of them, Michael, being a well known baritone at London concerts, and better known in America as Stephen Adams, composer of ""Nancy Lee"", and other popular songs. Five weeks ago James Maybrick went to London to see Michael. He complained then of feeling strangely unwell, and said that he had been taking medicine, which, instead of making him better, made him worse. He came back here, and a few days before the letter (which his baby dropped into the mud) was written he was obliged to take to his bed and he grew rapidly worse.Brierly is a dissipated looking fellow of about thirty eight years, with reddish hair and whiskers. The woman's affection for him is one of the strange features of the case. Brierly is practically under arrest. He was goin to leave the city, but the police stopped him. He was present at the inquest but was not called. He looked badly scared; all indications point to one of the most sensational murder trials on record. The police hint at still more damaging letters given up by Brierly. Medical men will be called to say that they were not consulted till too late to prevent the poison from taking fatal effect. It is rumored that Mrs. Maybrick will claim that her husband poisoned himself by taking an overdose of medicine with arsenic in it.MRS. MAYBRICK'S MOTHER.A Lady of Many Husbands and Some Queer Adventures.Mobile, Ala., May 31.Carrie E Holbrook-Chandler, the mother of Mrs. james Maybrick, is a woman with a very romantic career. Miss Holbrook came to Mobile about 1856, visiting her uncle, the Rev. J H Ingraham, rector of St John's church, author of the ""Prince of the House of David"" etc. She was very popular in society, being a good conversationalist, handsome and prepossessing. Among her admirers was young William G Chandler, sone of Daniel Chandler, one of the leading lawyers of the city. He followed her to her home in New York city, where they were married. Returning to Mobile they lived in good style, and Mrs. Chandler increased her influence in society. She was even as much of a belle as before her marriage.It was at the beginning of the civil war that Frank Du Barry turned up, being a captain in the ordnance department of the confederate government. Captain Du Barry was a remarkably dashing young officer. Soon there was some talk of his attentions to the lady. Suddenly Mr. Chandler fell ill and died. Some suspicious circumstances surrounded his illness. Mrs. Chandler did not attend the funeral. There were no official investigation of the charge, but it affected her position, which became so unpleasant that she took her two children and moved to Macon, Ga. In less than a year she married Du Barry there.Shortly afterwards Du Barry was ordered to go to Europe as representative of the confederate government. He and his family took passage on a blockade runner out of Charlestown or Savannah, it it not known which, and had proceeded but a couple of days when Du Barry, who had been ailing, suddenly died. the captain of the steamer proposed to return to port but the widow strenuously insisted that the vessel should continue and that the body be cast overboard. This was done and the vessel reached England in due time.In a year or two Mrs. Chandler drifted back to New York, where she was involved in a scandal with some actor. After this she went again to Europe, where she met and married Baron Von Rogue. It is said he was not faithful to her, and at one time gave her  beating, so she left him.When last heard from the woman was filling the position of wife of an attaché of the British Legation at Teheran, Persia. Since she left Mobile the Chandler family here have had nothing to do with her."

Dr. Popper testified that he had treated the patient for deranged digestion and nervous disorders. He has prescribed the use of strychnine, but never advised the use of arsenic. Maybrick had told witness that he was acquainted with the medicinal properties of arsenic. Witness stated that in June, 1888, Mrs. Maybrick came to him and asked him to speak to her husband about the habit of arsenic-taking, to which, she said, he was addicted. Maybrick had acknowledged to witness that he had struck his wife and given her a black eye during a quarrel about a gentleman. Witness further stated that Mrs. Maybrick had expressed to him a repugnance toward her husband and wished that she could obtain a separation from him.Dr. Humphreys, who had also attended Maybrick, testified that shortly before the patient's death he had given him directions that a few drops of the solution of arsenic be administered hourly to the sick man.A few drops of arsenical solution ordered by Dr. Humphreys were equal to one fifteenth of a drop of one per cent solution. The bottle of meat extract contained much arsenic. The waiter in a London hotel identified Brierly as a man who stayed with Mrs. Maybrick two days as her husband in March last. This testimony elicited groans and hisses, and the coroner threatened to clear the court. A letter was read which Mrs. Maybrick wrote to Brierly from jail, appealing for assistance and money, and stating that everything was known about their visit to London. The letter concluded: ""Appearances are terribly against me, but before God I swear I am innocent."""

There were four or five of them - several brothers and two sisters - the children of intemperate parents. Her sister had unfortunately inherited the craving, and before she was fourteen had taken to drink. The others became converted and did all in their power to cure the sister, but it was of no use.The sister at length married comfortably and children were born. But the craving for drink grew greater, and at length she was sent to a home for inebriates where she staid (sic) for a year. She left apparently, said the sister, a changed woman. Soon after, however, her husband caught a severe cold and before going out one morning drank a glass of hot whiskey, taking care, however, not to do so in the presence of his wife. Then, as was his custom, before leaving he kissed his wife. At once the fumes of the alcohol passed into her, and in an hour she was a drunk and roaring woman. She went from worse to worse, and at last left her husband and her children, one of them a cripple through her drunkenness. The husband died two years ago, a white-haired and broken-hearted man, though only forty-five years old. ""Need I add,"" said the sister in her letter, ""what became of her?

The evidence before the coroner's jury, on which has been based the verdict of wilful murder, is necessarily one sided. But people in a position to know the facts say that the details on which the accused relies to explain away the evidence against her will not hold water. In a letter produced at the close of the inquest and written to Mr. Brierly since her arrest, Mrs. Maybrick said: ""Appearances are terribly against me, but before God I am innocent.""Unless her friends in America come to her assistance she will have no money to employ counsel to conduct her defense, for the solicitors who defended her at the inquest were employed on the understanding that the brothers of the deceased would pay the expenses of the defense out of Mr. Maybrick's estate. This the brothers, however, positively decline to do, and the counsel have, in consequence, expressed their intention of withdrawing from the case. The sole benefit which Mrs. Maybrick can derive from her husband's estate under any circumstances is from certain insurance policies, to the amount of $125,000. If convicted of the murder she cannot even claim this. The only property to which she is entitled in her own right is a half interest in a house on Fourteenth street, New York. This house is mortgaged for more than its value. But it is let for a term of years at a rent which, after paying the mortgage interest and expenses, provides about $700 yearly between Mrs. Maybrick and her mother. Mrs. Maybrick, however. has only a life interest in this house, which reverts to her children after her death.Owing to the expert testimony required on the trial, the cost of the defense is sure to reach at least $7,000, and may possibly amount to three times as much.The case comes up for trial next August at the assizes."

The butcheries of Jack the Ripper have been emulated in at least twenty different cities of Europe and North America. Dynamite outrages and husband poisoning have repeatedly assumed the form of international manias, but even extraordinary and complicated crimes have occasionally been imitated with all details. Only a week ago the citizens of Willshire, O., were horrified by the discovery of a woman's body in a hovel, hear the Indiana state line, where a couple of miscreants outraged and murdered the victim, a young school teacher, who had persistently rejected their attentions. Now an exactly similar case is reported from Sandy Hook, Elliott county, Kentucky. A young lady who had discouraged the suit of a rustic admirer was enticed to an out of the way part of the county, dragged to the woods and killed, after having been chained a few days in a deserted cabin. Like the Willshire girl, the victim had been employed in teaching school and had no other protector than an aged mother.""Mrs. Maybrick AgainAlthough she is an American woman, a native of Mobile, Mrs. Florence Maybrick has found numerous strong friends in England who are doing their best to get her out of prison.It will be recollected that Mr. Maybrick, the Liverpool cotton merchant, died in 1889, and the autopsy showed traces of arsenical poisoning. His unhappy wife was arrested, convicted and sentenced to death, but the penalty was subsequently commuted to imprisonment for life.The conviction of Mrs. Maybrick was due to several unfortunate circumstances. It was proved that she administered arsenic to Mr. Maybrick. It was in evidence that she was carrying on a love intrigue with a Mr. Brierly. Justice Stephen, who presided, charged strongly against her, and exerted himself to secure her conviction.Now, for the other side. Maybrick used arsenic habitually, not only in England, but before he left this country. He dosed himself, and requested his wife to give him the drug. The hotel waiter who testified to Mts. Maybrick's intimacy with Brierly now solemnly states that he could not identify that lady and Brierly in court as the parties he had seen in the hotel, but was ordered by the police to swear that he recognized them. He obeyed orders, and now expresses his great regret for the harm that resulted from his testimony. One more point in the prisoner's favor. Justice Stephen has recently shown such unmistakeable signs of insanity that he has been forced to retire from the bench. This leads many to the conclusion that his strange anxiety to convict Mrs. Maybrick showed that his mind was unbalanced at that time. Mr. Alexander MacDougall, a well known English lawyer, has written a book entitled ""The Maybrick case"", which contains the following dedication:""This work is dedicated to James Chandler Maybrick, aged eight years, and Gladys Evelyn Maybrick, aged four years, by the author, with the sincere hope that it will enable them to feel during their lives that the word 'mother' is not 'a sound unfit to be heard or uttered' by them, and that when they are old enough to be able to understand this record of the facts and circumstances connected with the charge put upon and the trial of Florence Elizabeth Maybrick, aged twenty seven, her children may have, throughout their lives, the comfort of feeling that their mother was not proved to be guilty of the murder of their father, James Maybrick.""Mr. MacDougall is chairman of a committee which is endeavoring to secure Mrs Maybrick's pardon upon the grounds above stated. He closes his book with the following: ""Those who, like myself, after a deliberate study of the evidence (which I have honestly endeavored to lay exhaustedly before my readers) call her guiltless, must feel shame as long as a guiltless woman is passing a living death in our midst, and I invite every one who feels that shame to join in every legitimate effort to carry out the following programme:1) Mrs. Maybrick's release from prison as a matter of right and as an acknowledged innocent woman.2) The removal from office of all those who can be shown by their unconstitutional conduct to have been responsible for the miscarriage of justice which has taken place.3) The bringing to justice of any persons who can be shown to have recklessly and maliciously put the charge of murdering her husband upon Mrs. Maybrick.""It will be seen that all the important testimony against this lady was either doubtful or perjured, and that the presiding judge was probably crazy. If these are not good grounds for a pardon, it is difficult to see what more could be required.What adds interest to the case if the fact that the prisoner is closely related to some of the best families in Alabama and Georgia. Many prominent southerners have signed a petition in her behalf, and the circumstances justify the hope that she may soon be released from prison and restored to her children."

The woman was taken to the hospital. and after a time recovered sufficiently to tell of the attack made upon her. She is a German and, unlike the other woman murdered and mutilated in Whitechapel, she was not in the company of the man who attacked her, but was passing along the street when, without warning, the assassin sprang upon her. But for the old woman it was a scuffle for life.THINK IT IS JACK'S WORK.From what can be learned of the circumstances surrounding the attack, it appears that a man whom the people of Whitechapel are firmly convinced was the famous ""Ripper"", used his knife with fiendish energy. He grasped the woman by the head, and drawing her backward, with one hand across her mouth, silenced the cries she would naturally try to make, while with the other hand he drew his keen-bladed knife across her tightly-drawn throat, inflicting a terrible wound.Then, using the knife as a dagger, he plunged it into her body again and again. There is a deep wound on the woman's arm, which it is believed was received while she was attempting to ward off the ferocious blows aimed at her body. When released from the grasp of her assailant, the woman dropped to the ground with the blood pouring from her wounds, and when, shortly afterward, she was discovered by a passing policeman, she was unconscious and in a dying condition. She is seventy years old.NO CLUE DISCOVERED.The police are, as usual, hunting for some clue that will lead to the identification of the murderer, but, as in all the other Whitechapel crimes, the assassin has disappeared, leaving no trace, save his mutilated victim. She saw the glitter of the upraised steel blade, but was unable to escape from the grasp of her assailant. She raised her arm to defend her throat from the sweeping blow aimed at her, and it was through this movement that the wound in her arm was received. When her assailant released her from his grasp she fell upon a doorstep.Despite her terrible injuries, she still retained possession of her senses, and though the wound in her throat was bleeding profusely, she was able to articulate, the weapon not having reached her windpipe. Several persons passed while she was lying on the doorstep, and though they endeavored to ascertain what the trouble was, she could not speak English sufficiently well to make them understand that an attempt had been made to murder her.A BLOODY RAZOR.It is understood that the police found a razor covered with blood near the scene of the crime. The wound in the woman's throat could have caused by a razor as could also the deep cut in her arm, but from the nature of the other wounds, it is believed they were caused by either a knife or a dagger, as they appear to be stab wounds, and not such as would have been made with a razor.One man has been taken into custody on suspicion of being the assassin, but the evidence against him is very weak and no importance is attached to his arrest."

The knife was traced to one, Frank Castellano, an Italian barber, whose record has been under a police searchlight. They have discovered that until recently he was a fireman aboard one of the trans-Atlantic steamers. There are circumstances connected with the case that incline the police to believe that Castellano is no other than the mysterious duck, the ""ripper"", who kept London in terror for two years."

It is morally certain that De Jong has caused the disappearance of several young women, but whether he has murdered them or sold them to the managers of certain houses of vice, nobody knows but himself, and possibly his victims and their keepers. The prisoner has been remarkably successful in persuading women to leave their homes to follow him from place to place, and in every instance the girls have disappeared.The Amsterdam officials fear that they will have to release the accused. They say that is it not enough to prove that a person is simply missing. Some overt act that would result in the death of the person must be proved to make out the crime of murder. Holland has been thoroughly searched, but no trace of the women has been found, and it is impossible to say whether they are living or dead. De Jong has been questioned time and again, and every device has been employed to throw him off his guard, but he remains the same smiling mystery. He laughs at his prosecutors and predicts his speedy discharge. It is the theory of some that he is the famous Jack the Ripper who committed the Whitechapel butcheries, but no facts have been brought forward to sustain it.It is quite probable that the suspected man will soon regain his liberty and resume his secret work of decimating the female population of Holland."

A representative of this paper called  upon him at his residence, 33 Devonshire Street, N.W., three weeks ago, and the utterance that followed was made rapidly and enthusiastically. It should be said that almost every criminal case in Great Britain where insanity figures is referred to Dr. Winslow. It was to him that the home secretary turned for an opinion on Mrs. Maybryck's (sic) responsibility when the queen was petitioned to commute her sentence of death, and it was owing to the doctor's answer that the life of the unfortunate woman was spared. It was to Dr. Winslow that Jack the Ripper wrote the now famous letter:""Dear Sir: You will hear from me. JACK THE RIPPER.""The whole world did hear from him shortly afterward through thirteen dreadful murders. This letter is framed and hangs upon the wall of the doctor's study, and shows the mysterious criminal to have been a good penman and an epigram writer. The formation of the letters in this note corresponds with the writing the murderer left near the bodies of his victims, and there is no questioning its authenticity."

Every clue heretofore followed by the police has been found misleading, and the suspected parties have been discharged. Whether this businessman who is now under suspicion will turn out to be the guilty man remains to be seen.Why should this man take one street in a city, occupied by women of easy virtue, and make himself their executioner, stealing into their rooms and strangling them one by one? The murderer evidently has method in his madness. His use of a cord or a towel enables him to commit his crimes without any noise that would attract attention.Is the assassin a crank or a monster? Does he propose to continue his work until he exterminates all the fallen women in Denver?

Klosowski, a Pole, who, as George Chapman, kept a saloon in the East End of London, was arrested on the charge of killing pretty Maude Marsh, his bar maid and nominal wife, by poisoning her. Then it was discovered that two former wives of Klosowski's had died in suspicious circumstances and when the bodies were exhumed large quantities of antimony, the poison used by the murderer in killing Maude Marsh, were found in them. Klosowski's trial left no possible doubt that he had put all three women out of the way as he had grown tired of them and he was condemned to be hanged.It was first suggested that Klosowski might be Jack the Ripper when at his trial it came out that when the Police reached London in 1888 - the year of the Ripper crimes - he went to live in George yard, Whitechapel, where the first of the famous murderer's many women victims was found dead, and that this was his home during all the time when the assassinations were being committed. At the trial, too, a woman named Lucy Braderski (sic), whom the police had discovered and who proved to have been the murderer's first and real wife, testified that he had once attempted to kill her with a long knife - precisely such as weapon as that with which the Ripper is supposed to have mutilated his victims. The woman also testified that she and Klosowski once made a trip to the United States and lived there for several months. Soon after returning to this country they separated.Since Klosowski's conviction, Scotland yard, whose officials never have taken any stock in the cries that the Ripper was dead, or a lunatic, but who always have hoped to wipe off a stain on their record by nabbing him, have been working quietly on the clew thus gained.It is F.G. Abberline, former chief detective inspector of the Scotland yard forces, who now declares publicly his conviction that Klosowski was the Ripper. And ex-Inspector Abberline is the exact man who might be expected to take the greatest interest in this part of the murderer's record, as he it was who had charge of criminal investigations at the time of the Whitechapel crimes.Briefly, these are the reasons which the retired sleuth hound has just given to the present commissioner of police for his belief that Klosowski's arrival in London and residence in Whitechapel was coincidental with the beginning and duration of the Ripper murders.Then, there is the circumstance, which was brought out at the murderer's trial, that he studied medicine in Russia and was once an assistant surgeon, One of the features of the Ripper murders was the horrible precision with which the assassin's victims were mutilated - which at the time gave the idea that the criminal must be a physician.At Klosowski's trial, too, it was stated that, when he lived in Whitechapel, he was in the habit of wearing a peaked cap. Such a cap was worn by the Ripper. The Ripper, like Klosowski, was a man of middle height, and it is stated also that each of the few persons who claimed to have seen the Whitechapel murderer, described him as a ""foreign looking man.""There is also the circumstance that Klosowski once attempted to kill the only one of his wives who escaped from him alive by attacking her with a knife. But what has impressed ex Inspector Abberline most strongly of all is the fact that toward the end of 1888 Klosowski went to the United States to live. For one of the most sensational developments of the Ripper mystery was that, shortly after the murders ceased in Whitechapel, a series of crimes of the same sort began in America. At the time it was supposed that some American pervert merely had been inspired to imitate the London assassin example.There is still another  link in the chain with which, as the author of the Whitechapel murders, the ex Scotland yarder is seeking to forge about the Pole, Klosowski, and curiously enough, it also is particularly of interest to Americans.""While the coroner was investigating one of the East End murders,"" says ex Inspector Abberline, ""he told the jury a very queer story. You will remember that the divisional surgeon, who made the post mortem examination, not only spoke of the skilfullness with which the knife had been used, but stated that there was overwhelming evidence to show that the criminal had so mutilated the body that he could possess himself of one of the organs. The coroner, in commenting on this, said that he had been told by the subcurator of the pathological museum connected with one of the great medical schools that some few months before an American had called upon him and asked him to procure a number of specimens. He stated his willingness to give $100 for each. Although the strange visitor was told that his wish was impossible of fulfillment, he still urged his request. It was known that the request was repeated at another institution of a similar character in London. The coroner at the time said: 'Is it not possible that a knowledge of this demand may have inspired some abandoned wretch to possess himself of the specimens? It seems beyond belief that such inhuman wickedness could enter into the mind of any man; but, unfortunately, our criminal annals prove that every crime is possible!'""It is a remarkable thing,"" Mr. Abberline pointed out, ""that after the Whitechapel horrors America should have been the place where a similar kind of murder began, as though the miscreant had not fully supplied the demand of the American agent."" It was only yesterday that the veteran Scotland yarder's remarkable theory was made public, and at this time it cannot be said what steps will be taken toward confirming it. When convicted of the poisoning of his three wives, Klosowski, who so far had assumed a careless attitude, broke down completely and wept as sentence was being passed upon him. His lawyer who visited him in the condemned cell the other day, reported that the criminal was employed in writing out a lengthy statement of some kind, so that there is a possibility that Klosowski has decided to reveal himself as one of the most famous of modern criminals and is the man of all men upon whom the London police have, since the commission of the ghastly series of butcheries in Whitechapel, been most anxious to lay their hands."

Constantine had been working as timekeeper for a contractor at Tivoli, when his presence became known by the deputy sheriff. Constantine left the neighborhood and for some time spent his time around New York and Brooklyn. He had a sweetheart at Tivoli and by his letters to her, the deputy sheriff located him. Constantine made an appointment with his sweetheart and when he arrived at Tivoli a week ago Deputy Sheriff Hoffman arrested him.Constantine says he is not the man wanted. He first said this was his name and that the Chicago murder was committed by his brother and that his brother used the prisoner's name. Tonight he says his name is Fritz Constantine.Suspect Identified.For a week the sheriff's office awaited identification. This morning Miss Ellen Schreiber, who is cashier in a Chicago restaurant, came here and positively identified the prisoner. He had a week's growth of beard, but the woman was certain. The sheriff had the prisoner clean shaven and later the woman again stated that there was no doubt as to the prisoner being the Frank J. Constantine she saw in Chicago both in the restaurant, where he took his meals, and in a cab the day following the murder. Chicago officers are expected here tomorrow or Friday to take the prisoner to that city.Constantine admitted to the sheriff that he had served a term in the Elmira reformatory for burglary. It is known that the young woman who identified the prisoner today is using an assumed name, and that her name is not Ellen Schreiber, this name being assumed in order to escape notoriety in the case."

Huff was arrested at his home, rear of 80 Brotherton street, and when taken into the station house his ragged trousers up to his knees were heavy with blood and soft dirt. He is said to have been seen with the woman at a late hour Monday night.Again hurling defiance at Atlanta's police department, ""Jack the Ripper"" has claimed his eighth victim. The latest of the cut-throat murders committed within the city limits within the past few weeks came to light yesterday morning when the body of Sadie Holley, a negro woman, was found on Atlanta avenue near the south side trunk sewer line.And with equal defiance, and apparently an equal security from arrest, the gang of sneak thieves and burglars which has thrown Atlanta's homes into consternation continues, unmolested, to ravage where it wills.Neither Jack the Ripper on the one hand, nor the gang of thieves on the other has let up for one week in their terrorizing crimes. In fact, the deeds grow bolder and bolder with each successful evasion from capture at the hands of the police and detective departments of the city.Atlanta' sleuths, so far from capturing the cut-throat murderer, so far from obtaining even a clew to lead to the arrest of anyone of the thieves, have not even succeeded in making an arrest of anyone who even remotely might be suspected of having taken a part in the crimes. The negro is held on a ""suspicion.""The police department has nothing to say in explanation of its inability thus far to cope with the situation, further than the simple declaration that it is doing its best. In the meantime, the negroes, naturally panic-stricken that eight women of their race have been murdered in cold blood within as many weeks, are holding mass meetings, and are appealing to the governor, the mayor and to law-loving citizens to help them in capturing the guilty party or parties, and to put a stop to this reign of bloody crime.The white people of the community, indignant over the robberies which have been of so frequent occurence, and aroused as well over the murders which have served to intensify the servant problem, are turning to the police, to the mayor and to the governor for that degree of protection which will insure a reasonable amount of security in the home.Colored Detectives Wanted.The negroes, in a mass meeting at Pittsburg held Thursday night, asked that detectives of their own color be employed to help in running down the bloody cut-throats. Several rewards have been offered for the capture.All are asking that something be done - something more than is apparently being done now. They are asking for something that will be effective. The body of Sadie Holley, the latest victim, was found on Atlanta avenue, near the south side trunk sewer line. Her throat was cut and her head had been mashed with a large stone. A large crowd gathered, but none seemed to know the woman.Noticed Signs of Struggle.The murder was discovered by a negro laborer, Will Broglin, about 7 o'clock. He was on his way to work when he noticed, in the newly graded soft dirt, signs of a struggle. Following the traces, he came to the body. Call Officer Doyle was soon investigating, together with Detective George Bullard and Officer Arthur.Several clues were found, according to Chief Lanford, which give promise of yielding something definite, but so far no arrests have been made. The stone which was used as a weapon was found in a nearby field. The woman's shoes are missing, and have not been found. The trail of the slayer could be traced only a short distance in the soft dirt.Monday's murder is one of the series which has the police at sea, and which is causing consternation throughout the negro population. Meetings have been held in all the churches, the murderers denounced, and rewards offered, but there seems to be no stop to the crimes.First One Early in YearLooking back over the murders, it is seen that they have not started recently, but only in the last two months have they gained such frequency and regularity as to attract universal notice. The first one, ""negro woman murdered, throat cut by unknown persons,"" happened during the latter part of 1910.On February 19 an unknown woman was found near Grant Park with her head crushed and her throat cut. On January 22 Rosa Trice had been killed near Gardner street and the Southern railway in the same manner.From June 19 on there has been one murder weekly, starting with Addie Watts, who was found near railroad, her head mashed with a coupling pin andher throat cut. June 25 saw Lizzie Watts killed at White and Lawton streets, her body hidden in a clump of bushes. Lena Sharpe was murdered July 1 at 24 Hanover street, and her daughter Emma Lou stabbed. Emma Lou has given the only description that the police have of the man. The unknown of Monday night completes the list.The present crime wave is not confined alone to the negro sections.A Wave of CrimeOut in the best residence sections of the city a series of robberies, which have amounted to several thousand dollars' worth of fine jewels and glassware, have been committed by sneak thieves and burglars. In some cases citizens have been providing  special guards for their homes.Among the robberies which have taken place are: Charles L Gately, $1,400; Charles A Conklin, $500; George M Brown, $300; J G Oglesby, $300; Howard Candler, $300, and others.The servant theory of the police has been dissipated by the sneak thief at the Oglesby home Monday morning, and it is generally admitted now that the robberies are the work of one gang. Whether they are white or black is not known. It is possible that the city has been invaded by a number of professional crooks, who are making rich hauls.So far there is no evidence to connect anyone with the robberies, and the police are at sea with regard to the burglaries.Want Reward OfferedIn the hope of securing the arrest of the Ripper, negro pastors of Atlanta have started a petition asking the governor and mayor to offer a reward for his capture. It is as follows:""Within the last two years seventeen colored women have been found murdered in this community as follows:April 5, 1909, Della Reid, found dead in trash pile near 71 Rankin street.September 7, 1909. unknown, found dead in Peachtree creek.March 5, 1910.

Murphy Calling in Mayor and Governor to Take Action Looking to Arrest of the FiendNEGRO SERVANTS ARE WILD WITH TERRORThe state of mind of the serving population throughout the city, especially of the negro women who act as cooks in Atlanta homes, was shown last night when half a dozen were thrown into panic and hysterics by a negro man on the outskirts of the city.The women were frightened half to death, and the people for hundreds of yards around were aroused by their screams and shrieks. They fled before anyone could reach them, and a Mrs. McAdams of 704 DeKalb Avenue, reported the matter to the police.Spirited action was promptly taken at the station house, and Assistant Chief Jett, with Captain Mayo, set out for the scene of the trouble, while two call officers on motorcycles were dispatched on the same errand.On DeKalb avenue, between Pearl and Waddell streets, the officers found that six negro women, homeward bound, had been paralyzed by the sudden appearance of a negro man in a gloomy field, He was tall, and wore a black hat, but was in shirt sleeves. Their minds filled with terrors of the past weeks, they fled precipitately, and the man also disappeared.The incident, so far as ""Jack"" is concerned, is regarded as a joke, but it shows the point to which the fear of the darkies has come.Two ""Jack the Rippers"", both suspected of the same murder, are confined in the police station.The latest arrest is Todd Henderson, 35 years old, who was last night identified by Emma Lou Sharpe, who, on Hanover street, was badly cut some weeks ago, and who saw her mother murdered by her side.The other man was arrested Tuesday and there is much circumstantial evidence against him. His name is Henry Huff, and he is a thick set young negro, 27 years old.The case against Henderson seems very strong. He has been wanted since the first discovery of the murder, but had successfully eluded the officers in spite of the efforts to locate him until yesterday afternoon, when he was found in a Decatur street near beet saloon by Decetctive George Bullard, who is working on the case with Detectives Black and Harper.Identification Not Positive.Emma Lou Sharpe was notified, and appeared at the station house last night. She viewed Henderson and another negro; she saw him in full light and in the dark; she heard him speak, and her verdict was that he was the man to the best of her knowledge. Her identification was not positive, however, stated Chief Jennings, who was an interested observer.""How you gittin' 'long?"" Henderson was told to say, and as he spoke the girl shrank back, as if she recognized the voice that had threatened her at the time of her mother's murder.The partial identification of the Sharpe woman is greatly strengthened by that of a clerk in a grocery store near 24 Hanover street, where the crime was committed, who saw Henderson on the night of the murder. His identification was practically the same as that of Emma Lou Sharpe.Jim Patton, a negro, was in Cone's drug store, corner of Pryor and Decatur streets, Monday night, when Henderson went in accompanied by the Holley woman and made a small purchase. This was after 11 0'clock, and is a strong link in the evidence. The negro's statements are verified by Dr. Cone and one of the clerks.Evidence Is Strong.The circumstantial evidence against Henderson is most strong, declared the detectives last night. He was positively seen with the Holley woman after 11 o'clock Monday night, but has denied even knowing her. They say he has involved himself in a network of lies regarding his movements on the night of the crime and subsequent to it.A significant fact is that Henderson's shoe fits to the fraction of an inch the tracks left in the soft mud at the scene of the murder.""Mr. Bullard, you ain't 'rested me for nothin', but I live out there where this woman was killed,"" asserted Todd as he was taken from his cell last night by the detectives to be carried upstairs for identification.""If that was the case, Todd,"" answered Mr. Bullard, ""I would have gotten you long ago. Half a dozen negroes have been killed within half a mile of where you live.""Henderson lives at the West Point belt line crossing of Hill street, near where Sadie Holley was found with her throat cut and her head crushed with a coupling pin, not far from the woods beyond Grant Park, where an unknown was murdered, and some little distance from the negro section where two others met their fates.Cut Up His Wife.""Well sir, you know if I was goin' to kill anybody I would long ago have killed my wife,"" continued the prisoner.Henderson has been in a great deal of trouble on account of his wofe, whom he is said to have cut up two or three times. When he was arrested he was in a beer saloon spying on her while she paid a visit to a friend in the police station.Henderson fills very well the description given weeks ago by the Sharpe girl - a tall and powerful negro - but his clothes, of course, are different. He works for various persons in town, sodding grass and such jobs, and makes good wages.Henry Huff, who was the first negro locked up, was arrested at his home, rear of 81 Brotherton street, and the damaging fact against him was his blood-soaked and dirty trousers. He had a wound on the head, the result of a pool room fight, which he claimed caused the blood.Last night Detectives Coker and McGill found on his right arm, in the crook of his elbow, a group of marks that are seemingly finger nail scratches. He claims they are old marks. Circumstantial evidence has also been secured against him.The coroner's inquest over the body of Sadie Holley will be held this morning at 9 o'clock.GOVERNOR IS PETITIONED.Spurred to action by the ruthless slaughter of seventeen negro women in Atlanta and vicinity, whose murderers have gone unwhipped of justice, a large number of citizens, both white and colored, yesterday petitioned Governor Smith to offer rewards for the apprehension of the perpetrators of these crimes.The petition was circulated by Rev. H H Proctor and several other negro ministers of the city.  "

The Bright Side of the Gloomy Picture.The east end of London, the Whitechapel district, is probably the most degraded spot in Christendom.  The series of horrible murders which have been done there during the last year or two by a criminal, who for want of a better name is spoken of as ""Jack the Ripper,"" has called public attention to the district.""Whitechapel"" is the name given to the parish - or, rather, to the ""union"" of nine parishes, or which the old parish of St. Mary Whitechapel is the largest - beginning at the eastern side of the Aldgate boundary of the old ""city"" of London, and ,within 406 acres, containing, according to the census of 1881, 8,312 houses and a population of 71,363 human beings.Whitechapel is the recognized abode of poverty, wretchedness and crime in London.  It is a vast criminal colony in the heart of a great city.  Its population is made up of the outcasts of society - the lowest of the low.  In its narrow streets and narrower alleys, in its filthy court yards and vermin plagued tenements and lodging houses, thieves and abandoned women form the greater part of the population, while it is literally true - proved by the records of the London police - that the number of murders in proportion to the population is four times as great as in any other part of London.  Suicides, too, there are in grewsome plenty.  Many a beam or hook is pointed out to the visitor by some wretched inhabitant of the slums as the place where some other human being, only a trifle more wretched than the narrator (who laughs, perhaps, discordantly in the telling) took death by hanging as the easiest way open for a permanent removal from bloody Whitechapel.  Or a dark stain on floor or wall or wretched furniture tells the visitor who has braved the terrors of the ""registered lodging house"" more eloquently than words how some one has ended his wretchedness with a bullet or a knife.THE LODGING HOUSES.The ""registered lodging houses"" form a distinctive feature of this plague spot. To the thousands whose scanty store of coppers will not suffice to pay the few shillings demanded as rental for a room in one of the ricketytenements, these lodging houses furnish warmth and shelter.  There are many of them and they are all under police supervision.  Fourpence (eight cents) a night is the usual charge for a bed.  The smallest of the houses have from 50 to 75 beds and the largest from 200 to 250.  The linen is, according to police regulation, changed once a week.  Some of them bear on their dingy signs the words ""For Men Only,"" others are for women, while still others provide for both sexes and ""married"" couples.  In order to obtain accommodations in one of these places the price of a bed must be paid at the door.  At 10 in the morning the beds must be emptied.  In some of the lodging houses there are great kitchens on the lower floor, with bright fires burning in an open range or two, where the lodgers are allowed, without extra charge, to cook such poor provisions as they are able to buy, or sit around on the long benches warmed by the fire and smoking their pipes.THE WOMEN OF WHITECHAPEL.The women of the Whitechapel streets have reached the nethermost depths.  Generation after generation they come and go, knowing no life but that of the gutter, no language but that of the lowest ginshops, no association but with brutes in human shape.  Many, to be sure, have drifted here from brighter, better lives; but the surroundings are debasing in the extreme; there is no resisting them.  Dozens, scores, of these miserable creatures are absolutely homeless.  Nobody cares for them, few know them by sight, and fewer still know them by name.  They are the most abject of all creatures on earth.CASES IN OUTCAST LONDON.One of the features of Whitechapel is the Socialists' club.  It is located in Cleaver's yard, not far from where one of the murders was committed.There is a brighter side to Whitechapel life, however, of which but little has been written.  The rector of St. Mary's, Rev. A. J. Robinson, has done wonderful work among the east end poor.  He by no means confines his efforts to preaching.  He works and lives among the people, has clubs and classes for them, and brightens their lives in a hundred ways; and, curious to relate, he has a large personal following among the Jews.  Outside his church is an open air pulpit, the only one in England, where services are regularly held, and in the summer evenings no less than 300 rough looking people are ever in attendance there.Rev. S. A. Barnett, of St. Jude's, is another earnest worker among the masses of Whitechapel, and he, too, works in a thoroughly practical direction.  So, too, do the Oxford men at Toynbee hall, an institution not unlike the one that Robert Elsmere gave his life to establish.  The Bishop of Wakefield, in an admirable article in the Fortnightly Review, throws what to most people will be a new light on east end life, and takes an optimistic view.  He does not believe, with the writer of ""The Bitter Cry of Outcast London,"" that ""the poor are getting poorer, the wretched more wretched and the wicked more wicked,"" and he declares, indeed, that ""nothing can be more diametrically opposed to the fact.""  As a former east end clergyman and a worker among the poor, he may be credited with a clear personal knowledge of his subject.  ""I have,"" he says, ""met with no one who has known East London for the last twenty years who is not perfectly clear as to the great improvement that has taken place in every direction.""But how terrible the east end must have been twenty years ago!  It seems impossible that it could ever have been worse than it is today.  The bright spots of St. Mary's, St. Jude's and Toynbee hall are but small oases in the vast desert of Whitechapel misery and dirt and vice.  What the east end needs is emigration.  But who wants emigrants from the east end?  Surely not the American people, who have among them enough of this sort, and to spare.  But Whitechapel is overcrowded.  And, to make bad matters worse, its dense population, growing denser daily by natural (or ought one to say ""unnatural"") causes, is increased constantly by an influx of poverty from the continent."
100,index/austin_statesman_18880905.txt,austin_statesman,1888-09-05,"Austin Statesman (Texas, USA)Wednesday, 5 September 1888The English Murder Mystery.The dispatches this morning give a description in detail of the midnight assassin alleged to have perpetrated, last Friday night, the awful crime of the murder of Mary Ann Nichols.  The victim was literally cut to pieces with a knife in the hands of a mysterious being, whose footsteps could not be heard, while those of the woman resounded in the shadows as she fled from the murderer.  The crime, committed last Friday night, has shocked the whole of England, and is generally charged to a short, thickset, half crazy creature, with fiendish black eyes, and known as Leather Apron.  He frequented the dark alleys, and like a veritable imp haunted the gloom of the halls and passage ways of Whitechapel, and lived by robbing the female Arabs who roamed the streets after nightfall.  Of powerful muscle, carrying a knife which he brandished over his victims, the London murder fiend was too terrible an assailant for the victim that cowered beneath the glitter of cold steel.  He is charged with two other murders of women besides Mary Ann Nichols, in none of which was left the most distant clue to the assassin, whose identity is supposed to have been established by reports of women whom he had robbed, but not murdered.There is a striking similarity which must be a mere coincidence between these murderers across the water and the servant girl murderers in Austin in 1885, which latter remains a mystery as profound and unraveled as that of Whitechapel.  All were perpetrated in the same mysterious and impenetrable silence, and what makes the coincidence more singular is that the Austin murder fiend, who was seen on one occasion, was, like Leather Apron, a short, heavy set personage."

The fiend has added two more women to his victims, nor left a trace as to his identity.  The peculiar mutilation of the bodies, the silence in which they are slainno out-crythe impenetrable mystery that envelopes the assassinall tend to make a case almost entirely similar to the series of Austin woman murders three years ago, and which, like the Whitechapel butcheries, have never yet been explained.	The Fort Worth Gazette says: When the mysterious murders occurred in Austin a few years ago people were greatly shocked, but it was Texas, you know, and anything might be expected in that horribly wild place.  Now they are duplicated in the most populous city in the world.  Not only that, but the murders in London are committed before midnight and on a much traveled thoroughfare, while in Austin they were perpetrated at a late hour and in sequestered corners.  Mystery is a capricious mistress."

He procured assistance and putting off in a boat, towed the corpse in to the wharf. The police were informed and Coroner Wilson, called and at once empannelled and decided to hold an inquest. From the testimony (illegible) it appeared that the man's name was John Tumblety, that he was an Irishman and for some time past has boarded at a house near the Ferryway. He was missed some four weeks ago, but as he was somewhat eccentric in his habits, not much notice was taken of his disappearance, his friends thinking that he might have left town. He was about 45 years of age, a widower and leaves a daughter 11 years old who is living with some relatives in New York. Tumblety was addicted to the use of intoxicating liquors, and it is supposed he may have fallen off one of the wharves while under their influence.

The Stepney police station, where he is detained, was this morning surrounded by a vast crowd, mostly women, who uttered wild threats of lynching and tearing the prisoner to pieces. When he was removed to the police court an immense force of police was employed to keep the mob from doing him harm.The prisoner was placed in the dock this afternoon. His face was dirty and scratched. He seems utterly careless as to what happens to him and is apparently entirely composed. He kept his hands in his pockets and glanced calmly around him as if he was a disinterested spectator of the proceedings.During the course of the prisoner's examination a man testified to the fact that he had seen Sadler in company with the murdered girl Thursday night. As the witness was making his statement the prisoner watched him sharply and suddenly exclaimed, addressing the man in the witness box, ""Be careful about what you are saying.""Continuing, witness described in detail the visit of Sadler to a small coffee shop. Sadler, according to the witness, sat in the coffee shop with the murdered girl and seemed to be quarrelling with her. Sadler, the witness, said, claimed to have been robbed.

The story of his exploits and successes is almost a complete history of that famous home of England's Criminal Investigation Department known to the public as Scotland Yard, and to the nest of detectives themselves as C.O. - Central office. Most detectives have a speciality in criminal calendar, or, perhaps, more than one, to which they devote themselves. and consequently do inferior work in lines outside their own, but Moore always did credit to himself in whatever work fell to his hands. He admits one failure, however, and that is that he did not catch Jack the Ripper. Still, there is some satisfaction to him in the thought that even of he didn't succeed in getting the fiend of Whitechapel, no one else did any better.""The police,"" says Moore, ""were handicapped in their work. It was almost impossible to get anything like a trustworthy statement while every crank in England was sending postcards or writing on walls. The class of woman we had to deal with have told any number of stories for a shilling, and it was impossible to believe any woman, owing to the hysterical state of fear they get themselves into. If we had tried to keep under observation the persons we were told were ""Jack the Ripper"" we should have needed every soldier in the British army to have become a detective. We have in the East End foreigners from every corner of the earth, and when they hate they will tell such lies as would make your hair stand on end.Of course, every one wants to know who Jack the Ripper was, Well, so far as i could make out, he was a mad foreign sailor, who paid periodical visits to London on board ship. He committed the crimes and then went back to his ship, and remembered nothing about them. The class of victim made the work of the police exceedingly difficult. Why, once I had occasion to stand near the arch of Pinchin street Whitechapel, and I remarked to another office, 'This is just the place for Jack the Ripper,' and sure enough, some few months later a 'Ripper' body was found there in a sack. One of these days, now I have more leisure, I may go to work and before I die I might have the luck to see 'Jack the Ripper' standing in the door of the Old Bailey. It's the only failure I ever had but I'm not at all sure it is a failure yet."""

The body was enclosed in a polished elm and oak coffin, with metal mounts. On the coffin plate was engraved: ""Marie Jeanette Kelly, died 9th Nov., 1888, aged 25 years."" Upon the coffin were two crowns of artificial flowers and a cross made up of heartsease. The coffin was carried in an open car drawn by two horses, and two coaches followed, from the Shoreditch Mortuary. An enormous crowd of people assembled at an early hour, completely blocking the thoroughfare, and a large number of police were engaged in keeping order. As the coffin appeared, borne on the shoulders of four men, at the principal gate of the church, the crowd was greatly moved. Round the open car in which it was to be placed men and women struggled desperately to touch the coffin. Women with faces streaming with tears cried out ""God forgive her!"" and every man's head was bared. The site was quite remarkable, and the emotion natural and unconstrained. Two mourning coaches followed, one containing three, and the other five persons. Joe Barnett was amongst them, with someone from M'Carthy's, the landlord; and the others were women who had given evidence at the inquest. After a tremendous struggle, the car, with the coffin fully exposed to view, set out at a very slow pace, all the crowd appearing to move off simultaneously in attendance. The traffic was blocked, and the constables had great difficulty in obtaining free passage for the small procession through the mass of carts and vans and tramcars which blocked the road. The distance from Shoreditch Church to the Cemetery at Leytonstone by road is about six miles, and the route traversed was, Hackney-road, Cambridge Heath, Whitechapel-road, and Stratford. The appearance of the roadway throughout the whole journey was remarkable, owing to the hundreds of men and women who escorted the coffin on each side, and who had to keep up a sharp trot in many places. But the crowd rapidly thinned away when, getting into the suburbs, the car and coaches broke into a trot. The cemetery was reached at two o'clock. The Rev. Father Columban, with two acolytes, and a cross-bearer, met the body at the door of the little chapel at St. Patrick, and the coffin was carried at once to a grave in the north-eastern corner. Barnett and the poor women who had accompanied the funeral knelt on the clay by the side of the grave, while the service was read. The coffin was incensed, lowered, and then sprinkled with holy water, and the simple ceremony ended. The floral ornaments were afterwards raised to be placed upon the grave, and the filling-up was completed in a few moments, and was watched by a small crowd of people. There was a very large concourse of people outside the gates, who were refused admission until after the funeral was over."

At The Birmingham Public Office on Saturday, before Messrs. J.D. Goodman and W. Holliday (magistrates), Alfred Napier Blanchard (34), described as a canvasser, of 2, Rowland Grove, Rowland Road, Handsworth, was charged on his own confession with committing the Whitechapel murders.	Detective-sergeant Ashby said that on Friday night the prisoner was in a public-house in Newtown Row, and he told the landlord that he was the Whitechapel murderer. He repeated the statement to several people and witness arrested him. When at Duke Street Police Station he denied being the murderer, but witness thought proper to keep him in custody. The police had not yet had time to make inquiries, and knew nothing of the prisoner's antecedents. 	Richard King, landlord of the Fox and Goose, Newtown Row, said the prisoner came to his house about eleven o'clock on Friday morning, and remained till about a quarter past eight at night. During his stay in the house he drank about five and a half pints of beer. About half-past twelve o'clock he asked witness what kind of detectives they had in Birmingham. Witness told him he believed them to be very clever men. Prisoner said that it would be a funny thing if the Whitechapel murderer were to give himself up in Birmingham. Witness acquiesced, and prisoner continued, ""I am the Whitechapel murderer."" Turning round to an elderly gentleman sitting in the bar, prisoner said, ""Look here, old gentleman; perhaps you would not think there was a murderer in the house."" ""I don't know about that,"" replied the customer; ""you might not look unlike one."" Prisoner said, ""I am one, then."" Later on the old gentleman asked prisoner had he got the knife with him, and he answered that he had left a long knife behind him. Someone asked prisoner how he did the murders without making the victims scream. He explained that this was done ""simply by placing the thumb and finger on the windpipe and cutting the throat with the right hand."" He said he had ""done six of them in London."" He was sober when he made this statement. Turning round to witness prisoner said, ""You are a fool if you don't get the thousand pounds reward offered for me; you may as well have it as anyone else.""	Mr. Farndale (Chief Constable) informed the magistrates that he did not attach the least importance to this arrest. At the same time prisoner had placed himself in a most serious position, and could not complain if the magistrates thought fit to remand him for inquiries. At present nothing had been ascertained with respect to him beyond information contained in some papers found upon him.	Mr. Goodman thought that some further inquiries should be made.		The prisoner asked if he might say a few words, and, having obtained permission, stated that he was stationed in London, and was a canvasser for a London firm. He had recently been working up North. He was now on his way to London, and when he made the statement incriminating himself was labouring under great excitement, having been previously reading the reports of the inquests. The statement was, on the face of it, ridiculous, and he was sure they would admit that. He could give them references in Birmingham.	Mr. Barradale (Magistrates' Clerk) told the prisoner that he could give any references he had to Mr. Farndale for inquiry. As the prisoner said he was a murderer, it was a question whether time should not be given to make inquiries.	Mr. Goodman: It is your own fault that you are in this position.		The prisoner said he was aware of this, but at the same time he was labouring under great excitement.	Mr. Barradale: Were you suffering from the drink?		Prisoner: Partly from drink and partly from nervousness. I had been drinking for two or three days.	The prisoner was remanded until to-morrow.		Mr. Barradale told him that if he wished any messages to be sent the police would assist him in every way. He could telegraph to anybody living away from the town and write to anyone he thought proper.	As he was proceeding towards the cells, prisoner said he had a favour to ask. Would the press be kind enough not to mention this case? It was a serious matter for him, and should his employer get to hear about it he would lose his situation.	Mr. Barradale: The magistrates have no power over the press.		The prisoner then went below.  "

A feverish desire to run him to earth, combined with a notion that they command the acumen of a {illegible}, goads them on to be ever on the alert for a ""dark man with a black bag."" Under these circumstances the danger of carrying a black bag is very great. It resulted in the attention of the police being called to a suspect in Birmingham during the week. Late on Tuesday night a commercial traveler with a small black bag was hurrying down Stephenson Place to catch a train, when he was pounced upon by a strongly-built man. The suddenness of the attack took the possessor of the bag by surprise, and wishing to escape from the rather tight grip his assailant had of his throat, he began to struggle violently. The unknown retaliated and shrieked for help, but before the police arrived the pair were wriggling on the pavement. The strife having ended, the gentleman wished the constable to arrest his assailant for assaulting him, while the latter requested the policeman to lock the unfortunate owner of the black bag up for being the Whitechapel murderer. He was never as sure of anything in all his life, he contended, and, therefore, insisted upon his arrest. The policeman saw that the too zealous murderer-hunter was under the influence of drink, and escorted him to Moor Street, while the traveler proceeded on his journey. The prisoner did not grieve over his arrest; his only trouble being that the other man had been permitted to escape. He expressed himself confident that the constable would merit dismissal in the morning, but when before the Court the prisoner seemed exceedingly glad to escape with a small fine.__________     There was another Whitechapel scare in Birmingham the night before last. A man was seen hanging about Ladywood Road, peering into the face of every female that passed by. The rumour went abroad that he was the Whitechapel murderer, and one terrified female actually went to Ladywood Police Station for a detective to arrest him. I believe a policeman did investigate the mysterious stranger, and he turned out to be an inoffensive short-sighted young gentleman who had arranged to meet his sweetheart at ten o'clock but the lady had failed to keep her appointment. Being very short-sighted he made a close scrutiny of the features of every petticoated pedestrian, and hence the alarm that his prescence {sic} excited among the fair sex. It is a fact that several women in the neighbourhood were as excited by the rumour that they were afraid to go to the public-house for their supper beer. "

In the one case where this was not done the body was still warm and bleeding, indicating that the perpetrator had been frightened away before completing his task.During the same period the corpse pf a woman similarly mutilated was found in a town in the north of England; and if, as seems likely, the murderer was the same, this makes his eighth victim. The first two cases excited no great interest, as quarrels and murders are no new thing in the Whitechapel district, but the horrible monotony of the crimes has since made this a case of world importance. Alienists are unanimous in the opinion that the murderer is a monomaniac with a homicidal turn; and many add that he is what medical science calls a ""sexual pervert"" - that is, a man in whom the natural instincts have been changed by disease or excess into a blind hatred and desire to kill and mangle. The London police have been completely at sea, and some of the theories put forth by their chief are too absurd for one's patience. One, for instance, was that an American medical student did the deeds because he wanted to collect a number of anatomical specimens! The most remarkable theory is that the monomaniac has been injured, or thinks he has, by one of these women, and is wreaking his vengeance on the class. His cunning is wonderful - not an uncommon thing in monomaniacs. Dr. William hammond, the eminent alienist, very sensibly says that the police have gone wrong from the start, because they have looked only for a self evident villain, a man ""whose face would go far to hang him,"" while the probabilities are many to one that the perpetrator is a decorous and soft spoken gentleman, living an apparently virtuous life, a man whose closest acquaintances do not suspect of crime.Chief Inspector Byrnes of New York city, accepts the opinion of Dr. Hammond and insists that the New York police could have caught the man by using the women as decoys. He adds:""We caught the fellow who had a mania for throwing vitriol upon women's dresses red handed immediately after it was reported. His crime was localised. He frequented Fourteenth street. I made victims for him, and my men were thickly scattered through that district. We have no such autocratic powers as the London police, but if a crime is so plainly localised in one particular district, as in the case of these London murders, we would most assuredly arrest the perpetrator in short order."""

At 11 o'clock this morning the body of a woman cut in two was discovered in a house on Dorset street, Spitalfields. The victim, like all the others, was a prostitute. She was married and her husband was a porter. They had lived together at spasmodic intervals. Her name is believed to be Lizzie Fisher. She had a room in the house where she was murdered and carried a latch key. The woman's head had been severed and placed beneath one of the arms and her ears and nose had been cut off. The body had been disemboweled (sic) and the flesh was torn from the thighs. The womb and other organs were missing. The skin had been torn off the forehead and cheeks and one hand had been pushed into the stomach. Three bloodhounds were taken to the place where the body lay and placed on the scent of the murderer, but they were unable to keep it any distance. The murdered woman told a companion last evening she was without money and would commit suicide if she did not obtain a supply. It has been learned that a man, respectably dressed, accosted the victim and offered her money and they went to her lodging on the second floor of a Dorset street house. No noise was heard during the night and nothing was known of the murder till the landlady went to her room early this morning to ask for rent. The first thing she saw on entering was the woman's breasts and riscera (sic) lying on the table. Dorset street is a short and narrow street and situated close to Mitre square and Han (sic) street."

There has been a strong suspicion entertained here that Deeming is none other than the notorious Jack the Ripper, the slayer of Whitechapel, London, outcasts, and this suspicion is borne out in a measure not only by Deeming's appearance , which closely tallies with the description given of the Whitechapel fiend, but by his alleged confession. The Argus is a reliable newspaper, and there is no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the statement it makes that Deeming has acknowledged that he killed his wife and four children at Dinham villa, at Rain Hill, near Liverpool, and that he murdered and mutilated the last two women whose bodies were found in the purlieus of Whitechapel. Although he has confessed that these two Whitechapel women fell victims to his mania for murder, he, while not denying, does not admit that he killed the other Whitechapel women, whose murders at the time attracted the attention of the whole world. It is believed, however, that when he finds all hope of escape from the clutches of the law cut off he will confess not only these murders, but others of which the police know nothing. In his confession, The Argus says, Deeming makes no mention of his object in mutilating the bodies of his Whitechapel victims, and removing certain of the organs, but, it adds, there us scarcely a doubt that the man is afflicted with a disease similar in some respects to nymphomania. The case is a most peculiar one in all its respects, and public curiosity here is excited to the highest pitch to learn all the details of Deeming's many crimes. It is said that Deeming made his confession to an official at Perth, West Australia, where he was arrested on the charge of having murdered his wife at Windsor, a suburb of Melbourne. Deeming secured counsel and made a strong fight against being sent back to Melbourne, but the court ordered his surrender to the authorities of the city and he has started in custody of the officers on his return. He told the Perth official, to whom he made his confession, that he was not guilty of the Windsor murder. His wife, he claimed, had eloped with another man."

The crime is the most atrocious in the criminal history of Chicago. The methods  for the murder were those of Jack the Ripper, and were more fiendish in detail than those which he employed. When Walsh came  home to supper at 6 o'clock he found the body of his wife on the floor, destitute of clothing excepting a pair of shoes. A  pair of scissors was sticking up to the hilt through her right breast and by actual count there were sixty five jagged stabs  in her body. One great gash across the abdomen allowed the intestines to protrude. The most hideous part of the crime was  discovered when a portion of a broom handle, three feet long, was found protruding from her body. This, with wounds about the  woman's loins, gave the butchery a startling resemblance to those of the Ripper fiend. The police were at once notified and  soon made the discovery that Thomas Walsh, nephew of the dead woman, had been at the house nearly all the afternoon. Walsh  was promptly arrested, and when confronted with the evidence of his crime confessed, giving complete details of the horrible  deed. He had made insulting proposals to his aunt, been repulsed, attempted an assault, and seizing the pair of scissors with  which the unfortunate woman had attempted to defend herself, he stabbed her till she was unconscious.

The latest report that another murderous attempt had been made by the monomaniac whose repeated butcheries have horrified London, in spite of every effort of the police, proves to be unfounded, but the false alarm is even more expressive of the panic which has possessed the minds of the people. It is feared, with some reason, that the mental atmosphere of London, and even of all England, may become so charged with morbid excitement on this subject that weak heads will be turned and a fiendish fanaticism become epidemic, manifesting itself in a desire to follow in the footsteps of the unknown slayer of Whitechapel outcasts. There have not been wanting indications of this danger. Within the past month numerous cases have been reported to the metropolitan police of men threatening women with such treatment as Annie Chapman received. Scarcely less revolting than these threats are the practical jokes in which brutal fellows have indulged by personating the murderer, and which in one instance lately reported, caused a woman to die in convulsions resulting from fright. But the most sickening proof of the apprehended peril was furnished by a letter which the police authorities at Tunbridge Wells received not long ago, signed ""Another Whitechapel Murderer,"" and purporting to be written by a boy. It was found that the author of the letter was a lad of 16 years, who, as he confessed, with the aid of an accomplice of his own age had actually committed a murder which had before remained an impenetrable mystery.	The latest developments in the Whitechapel problem will doubtless, as soon as the panic subsides to some extent, serve to call additional attention to a matter about which much, but not nearly enough, has been said by the leaders of English opinion during the past few weeks. We refer to the conditions existing in the East End of London which afford opportunity for such crimes has have been recorded. Whoever would study this subject must begin by giving attention to the sort of hives in which the populace swarms throughout that whole region. The buildings are, for the most part, old, dilapidated, miserable in their appointments, destitute of sanitary arrangements, facing on narrow streets, flanked by crooked, dark alleyways, and noisome courtyards. They are inhabited by human creatures crowded together in such excess [as to] make privacy, health, or decency out of the question. Tenants and lodgers are constantly driven out of doors for failure to pay the rent demanded for their wretched accommodations. Different families sometimes huddle together in the same apartments, although strangers to each other. Poverty is universal, pitiful and seemingly hopeless. Theft, beggary and vice are so common as to excite only languid interest. To a great extent the dwellers in Whitechapel are so absorbed in the unending struggle to maintain physical existence that their sensibilities are blunted and their perception even of sights and sounds is rendered dull. 	It is evident that no field more inviting than this to such a savage as the original murderer is supposed to be can enter into the imagination. All the conditions, material and moral, are provided for the accomplishment of unlimited slaughter and the enjoyment of unmolested security. ""Deep searching of hearts, humiliation of spirit, and sorrowful reflections over the causes which make these unspeakable atrocities possible,"" are the solemn words with which the London Times of November 10 concluded a leading editorial on the tragedy of the day before. ""So tens of thousands of us live now in the greatest city of the world,"" sorrowfully remarks the Daily News.	It may be that the divine providence, which is evermore bringing forth good out of evil, will cause to spring up, from the unparalleled horror with which the Whitechapel murders have inspired the public mind of London, a determination to cleanse that loathsome ulcer upon the body politic. Possibly multitudes who have neither known nor cared how other multitudes of their fellow creatures lived, will care now that they cannot help knowing. The bishop of Bedford has set on foot a movement to establish in Whitechapel an institution to be called the ""Home and Refuge."" Lady Kinnaird is using her great social influence in the West End to interest women of wealth and rank to do something for the material and moral improvement of society in the East End. Too much cannot be done, and it cannot be done too soon."

Up to this time seven victims have fallen under the skilful knife of an unknown fiend, and there remains not a particle of a clew on which to hang a hope of discovery of the murderer.From beginning to end the tragedies have been marked by many circumstances and inexplicable details which fill all with terror and dismay the eager Scotland Yard detectives.  One after another the mutilated bodies of the victims of this mysterious demon have been picked up on the most populous thoroughfares, but no one has seen the murderer, and the police know not where to turn to begin the task of discovery.In every case the unmistakable handiwork of the same fiend is too painfully apparent to admit of doubt.  Madman he probably is, but with all his boldness he is possessed of a cruel cunning which allows him to stalk about the public highways, striking down his victims as he pleases, and leaving not even the faintest clew to his personality.  Until more is known of the murderer no conception can be formed of the object of his horrible crimes, unless it is reasonable to at once conclude that it is the work of a maniac.  To accredit those murders to a desire for anatomical experiments, and to attempt to roughly guess that some American collector is at work, as Coroner Baxter thinks, is the imagination of an imbecile.  Whatever the objects of these wholesale murders and whoever the murderer may be, every civilized nation waits in anxious suspense for the horrible mystery to be solved.The first of what have now become famous asThe Whitechapel Murdersoccurred somewhat less than 12 months ago in that section of London where the scum of the vile dens of vice are turned loose upon the streets when the police close the brothels at early morning, and the floating population of criminals and fallen women continue their revels undisturbed.  Although the first victim was a woman of the lowest class, and her body was mutilated in the same shocking manner that has characterized the recent murders, nothing more than a passing notice was given the affair by the police.  A murder was no uncommon occurrence in Whitechapel, and the very fact that the victim was a blear-eyed, gin-soaked unfortunate, led the authorities to believe that she had quarrelled with one of her own associates, and the matter had ended as many as drunken quarrel had ended there before.  The policeman on the post was closely questioned, his immediate superior viewed the remains and the coroner observed  that the crime was one of shocking brutality.  The London press commented a little, the case dropped from the attention of the police, and the first of the Whitechapel murders passed out of mind.On Tuesday, Aug. 7, the body ofMartha Turner, a Hawkerwas found lying upon the first floor landing of the dwellings known as George Yard buildings, Commercial street, Spitalfields, Whitechapel district.  The previous day was what is known as bank holiday, and it was late in the evening of that day that the murder was committed.  When the body was found, it was horribly mutilated after the manner of the first victim.  The hand of the murderer was clearly seen to be the same in both cases.  As nearly as the police could determine both victims had been seized from behind by a powerful arm, and their throats cut by a swift stroke from some razor-edged knife.  Such was the force of this death-blow, and such the keenness of the weapon, that the head was almost severed from the body, and the knife had even left its imprint upon the bone at the back of the neck.But more remarkable than the ghastly work at the throat was the discovery that the woman had received no less than 39 distinct, deep and clear cuts upon various parts of her body.  From these wounds the blood had poured forth, saturating her clothes and covering the steps on which she lay with aSlippery Coating of Coagulated Blood.Examination of the body revealed the same indescribable mutilation that had marked the first murder.  The underclothing had been thrown roughly up over the shoulders and a jagged wound crossed the bowels, laying bare the intestines.  Below this a portion of the womans body had been cut out with the nicety and skill of a surgeons knife, leaving only a quivering and bleeding aperture.  The police jumped to the conclusion that the murderer had saved the part removed for an anatomical collection.  Several friends of the victim were arrested and held for the coroner, but little was found that cast any light upon the crime.  At the inquest Mary Ann Connelly, Pearly Poll, was called, but Inspector Reid of the police asked that she might be cautioned previous to being sworn.  This the coroner did, and she said that she had been lodging at a lodging-house in Dorset street.  She was a single woman, and gained her livelihood on the street. She had known the deceased four or five months, under the name of emma.The Last Time She Saw Her Alivewas on bank holiday, at the corner of George yard, Whitechapel.  They went to a public house together, and parted about 11.45.  They were accompanied by two soldiers, one a private and the other a corporal.  She did not know to what regiment they belonged, but they had white bands round their caps.  Witness did not know if the corporal had any side arms.  They picked up the soldiers together and entered several public houses, where they drank.  When they separated the deceased went away with the private.  They went up George yard, while witness and the corporal went up Angel alley.Before they parted witness and the corporal had a quarrel, and he hit her with a stick.  She did not hear deceased have any quarrel.  Witness never saw the deceased again alive.  Deceased was a woman who did not drink much.  Witness had tried to identify the two men at one of the barracks, where the men were paraded before her.  She picked out two men who she thought were the same that were with her and the deceased on the night of the murder.  That was at Wellington Barracks.  SheHad Never Seen the Men Before.Witness left the corporal at the corner of George yard about 5 or 10 minutes past 12, and afterwards went along Commercial street towards Whitechapel.  She heard no screams, and was first informed of the murder of Tuesday.That was all that the authorities succeeded in ascertaining in regard to Whitechapels second horror.The public had scarcely recovered from the shock of this murder in the East End of London, when a second atrocity of an exactly similar kind occurred at Whitechapel, in this instance, also, a woman was the victim.  The throat was cut open from ear to ear, and the lower part of the abdomen was completed ripped up, with the bowels protruding, the wound extending nearly to her breast.The brutality of the murder is beyond conception, and beyond description.  The throat was cut in two gashes, the instrument having been a sharp one, but used in a most ferocious and reckless way.  There was a fash under the left ear, reaching nearly to the centre of the throat.  Along half its length, however, it was accompanied by another one, which reached around under the uother ear, making a Wide and Horrible Hole,and nearly severing the head from the body.  The ghastliness of this cut, however, paled into insignificance alongside the other.  No murder was ever more ferociously and more brutally done.  The knife, which must have been a large and sharp one, was jabbed into the deceased at the lower part of the abdomen and then drawn upwards twice.  It was evident that the murder was committed some distance from the place where the body was found.  This was in Bucks row, about midway its length.  Bucks row is a short street occupied half by factories and half by dwellings.  Half way down the street is the house of Mrs. Green.  Next to it is a large stable yard, whose wide, closed gateway is next to the house.  In front of the gateway the woman was found.  Constable Neil, who was the first person to see the body, immediately after awoke the Green family and asked them if they had heard any unusual noise.  Neither Mrs. Green, her son, nor her daughter, all of whom were sleeping within a few feet of where the body lay, hadHeard Any Outcry.All agreed that the night was unusually quiet.I should have heard it had there been any, said Mrs. Green when interviewed, for I have trouble with my heart and am a very light sleeper.Another person, a Mrs. Perkins, who lives across the way from Mrs. Greens house, also denied having heard any sounds of disturbance in the street during the night.There are, however, a number of people who contradicted these statements, and say that they distinctly heard the screams of a woman early on the morning of the crime.  A Mrs. Conville, who lives near the place, said: I was wakened early on Friday morning by my little girl, who said someone was trying to get into the house.  I listened and heard screams.  They were in a womans voice, and, though frightened, were faint-like, as would be natural if she were running.  She was screaming Murder, police! Murder, police!  She screamed this give or six times, and seemed to be getting further away all the time.  I heard no other voice and no other steps.  She seemed to be all alone.  I think I would have heard the steps if anybody had been running after her, unless they wereRunning on Tiptoe.The Scotland Yard detectives at once searched everywhere in the vicinity in the hope of discovering some clew.  None was found.  In fact, everything seemed to indicate that the murder was committed some distance away, as drops of blood were found along the sidewalk; but what perplexed the police most was the fact that the blood stains were found on both sides of the street.  The body of the unfortunate woman was removed to the mortuary, and steps were taken to have it identified, but at first with little prospect of success.  Some of the clothing bore the stamp of the Lambeth workhouse.  This, however, afforded little assistance, as clothing is distributed at the workhouse to any poor people who apply for it.  A comb and a piece of looking-glass found in the pocket led the police to believe the murdered woman was an inhabitant of one of the common lodging-houses in the neighborhood.  Officers were despatched to make inquiries here, and eventually some women from a lodging-house at 18 Thrawl street, Spitalfields, were found who Identified the Body as That of Polly,as she was called, who shared a room with three unfortunates in the house on the usual terms of fourpence a night.On the night of the murder she was turned out of the house because she had not the money.  She was then a little the worse for drink, and said to a companion as she turned away, Ill soon get my doss money.  See what a jolly bonnet Ive got now.  The lodging-house people only knew her as Polly, but later a woman from the Lambeth workhouse identified her as Mary Ann Nicholls, aged 42.  The deceased woman had been an inmate of the workhouse and had left it to take a situation as a domestic servant, but after a short time absconded with £3 of her employers money.  From that time she had wandered about the streets.The police theory was at that time that a sort of high-up gang existed in the neighborhood which, blackmailing women of the unfortunate class, takes vengeance on those who do not find money for them.The Fourth Murderrivalled in many respects any of the preceding horrors, and, like the rest, showed at a glance the same hand and the same mysterious purpose in its details of mutilation and methods.  She was, like the others, one of the citys unfortunates, and had led the same life, among the same associates, and in the same section of the city.At a spot only a few hundred yards from where the mangled body of the poor woman Nichols was found just a week before, the body of another woman, mutilated and disfigured, was found at 5.30 on Saturday morning.  She was lying in the back of 29 Hanbury street, a house occupied by Mrs. Richardson, a packing-case maker.  As late as 5 oclock on Saturday morning, it is said, the woman was drinking in a public house near at hand called the Ten Bells.  Near the body was discovered a rough piece of iron, sharpened like a knife.  The wounds upon the woman were more fearful than those found upon the body of the woman Nicholls, who was buried on Thursday.  The throat was cut in a most horrible manner and the stomach terribly mutilated.The discovery of the body was made by John Davies, living on the top floor of 29 Hanbury street, Sept. 8, in the yard of which the body was found.  Mr. Davies was crossing the yard between 5 and 6, when he saw a horrible looking mass lying in the corner, partly concealed by the steps.  He instantly made for the station and notified the police, without touching the body.  Meantime Mrs. Richardson, an old lady, sleeping on the first floor front, was aroused by her grandson, Charles Cooksley, who looked out of one of the back windows and screamed that there was A Dead Body in the Corner.Mrs. Richardsons description makes this murder even more horrible than any of its predecessors.  The victim was lying on her back, with her legs outstretched.  Her throat was cut from ear to ear.  The abdomen was exposed, the body having been ripped up, exposing the intestines.  No more horrible sight ever met a human eye, for she was covered with blood and lying in a pool of it.Mr. and Mrs. Davies occupy the upper story of 29 Hanbury street, the house consisting of two stories.  When Mr. Davies found the woman she was lying on her back close up to the flight of steps leading into the yard.  The throat was cut open in a fearful manner - so deep, in fact, that the murderer, evidently thinking he had severed the head from the body, tied a handkerchief so as to keep it on.  The fiendish work was completed by the murderer tying a portion of the entrails around the victims neck.  There was no blood on the clothes.Hanbury street is a long street, which runs from Bakers row to Commercial street.  It consists partly of shops and partly of private houses.  In the house in question, in the front room on the ground floor, Mr. Harderman carries on the business of a seller of cats meat.  At the back of the premises are those of Mr. Richardson, who is a packing-case maker.  The other occupants of the house are lodgers.  One of the lodgers, Robert Thompson, who is a carman, went out of the house at 3.30 in the morning, but heard no noise.  Two girls, who also live in the house, were talking in the passage until 12.30 with young men, and it is believed that they were the last occupants of the house to retire.It seems thatThe Crime Was Committedsoon after 5.  At that hour the woman and the man who in all probability was her murderer were seen drinking together in the Ten Bells, Brick lane.  But though the murder was committed at this late hour, the murderer, as in the other case, silently and stealthily managed to make his escape.On the wall near where the body was found there was, according to one reporter, discovered written in chalk: Five; 15 more and then I give myself up.  Davies, the lodger who discovered the body, immediately communicated with the police at Commercial-street station and Inspector Chandler and several constables arrived on the scene in a short time when they found the woman in the condition described.  An excited crowd gathered in front of Mrs. Richardsons house.  Several persons who were lodging in the house, and who were seen in the vicinity when the body was found, were taken to the station and closely examined, especially the woman last with the deceased.  Inquiries led to the discovery that the woman was known by several names.  Her real name was Annie Chapman, but she had latterly passed as Annie Silvy, and rejoiced in the nickname of Dark Annie.  Her age was about 45.  She was 5 feet high, had a fair face, brown, wavy hair, blue eyes and, like Mary Ann Nicholls,Had Two Teeth MissingOne peculiarity of her features was a large, flat kind of nose.Mrs. Fiddymont, wife of the proprietor of the Prince Albert public house, better known as the Clean House, at the corner of Brushfield and Stewart streets, half a mile from the scene of the murder, told the police that at 7 oclock Saturday morning she was standing at the bar talking with another woman in the first compartment.  There suddenly came into the middle compartment a man whose rough appearance frightened her.  He had a brown stiff dark hat and no waistcoat.  He came in with his hat pulled down over his eyes and with his face partly concealed, and asked for half a pint of ale.  She drew the ale and meanwhile looked at him.  As soon as he saw the woman in the other compartment watching him he turned his back and got the partition between them.  There were blood spots on the back of his right hand.  His shirt was torn.  As soon as he had drank the ale, which he sawllowed at a gulp, he went out.  he wore a light blue check shirt, which was in rags.  There was a narrow streak of blood under his right ear, parallel with the edge of his shirt.The man was rather thin, about 5 feet 8 inches high, and apparently between 40 and 50 years of age.  He had a shabby genteel look, pepper and salt trousers, which fitted him badly, and dark coat.  The man walked, holding his coat together at the top.  he had a nervous and frightened way about him.  He wore a ginger-colored moustache and had short sandy hair.This man is probably the fiend whom the police seek, but who is still at large and unknown.On Sunday, Sept. 23, the body of a woman, an unfortunate, was found at Gateshead, near New Castle-on-the-Tyne.  Although Gateshead is so far from London the similarity of this crime in all respects to the other members had induced the belief among many thatThe Same Unknown Fiendperformed it.  If this is so, this murder is the fifth in the history of the Whitechapel horrors.  Whether or not it be true that the Whitechapel brute reacted so far from the scene of his other crimes as Gateshead, it is certainly worth attention, from the fact that the mutilation of his victim is identical with the cutting and slashing found upon the bodies of the others.  The throat was cut with a long, clean sweep of some exceedingly sharp weapon.  The clothing was thrown up over the victims head and the same organ was found to have been removed as before.And now comes the latest chapter of these mysterious murders with the slaying of two more women in a single night.  The victims of Sunday night were of the unfortunate class who ply their trade in the dingy alleys and dimly lighted streets of the East End.  The first of these two murders was committed on Berner street, Whitechapel, which is a thoroughfare of the dissolute and depraved.  Next to the Socialist Club is a stable-yard, guarded at the street line by gates of solid wood, left open during the night for members of the club and people living in the adjoining tenements.  Sunday morning, about 1 oclock, the steward of the Socialist Club went out on an errand, leaving the wooden gates open.  When he returned, a few minutes later, he found the gates neatly closed and a woman with her throat cut from ear to ear and quite dead, jammed between them.There was no mutilation of the body as in the previous Whitechapel crimes.  It was a brutal murder committed in a populous thoroughfare patrolled by the police.  The head was almost severed.  The body was identified by a woman as that of Hippy Lip Annie, a dissolute character familiar in the neighborhood.  Saturday night she was seen carousing in the public houses in the company of several men.  When and by whom she was murdered is a mystery, but all the circumstances go to show that it was certainly the work of a person known to the police and the newspapers as the Whitechapel murderer.  It is known that the spot where the body was found was passed by a policeman only a few moments before the body was discovered.  As the throat was cut and the face mutilated as in the other instances, it is reasonable to suppose that the only reason the other mutilations of the body were not found is because the murderer was frightened away before he had completed his task.In the case of the second murder of last Sunday, or the seventh of the fiends victims, the place selected for the crime, the nature of the throat wound that caused instantaneous death, and the dreadful mutilations of the body, all go to show the work of the same hand that committed the four previous atrocious murders that are shrouded in mystery and have made the whole world shudder.  This murder was committed quite outside the balliwick of the Metropolitan police and in the territory patrolled by the City of London police, an entirely distinct organization of about a thousand men.These circumstances make the murder committed this morning the most daring of the Whitechapel series, and strengthens the general impression that they are the Work of a Homicidal Maniac.No sane man would have chosen such a place for such a crime.  But if the murderer is a maniac he is wonderfully shrewd and clever, and one skilled in the use of the knife and familiar with the devices of the dissecting table.  Every stroke of his knife cuts into a vital part.  In short, he is a skilled anatomist.The body was found at 1.45 a.m. in the southwest corner of Mitre Square, a spot which Watkins, the watchman, had passed on his beat a quarter of an hour before, which shows with what despatch the woman-killer must have worked.  The body was lying on its back on the footway with its head towards the wall and the feet towards the carriage way.  The head was inclined on the left side and both arms were extended outward.  The left leg was straight out and the right leg bent away from the body.The body was warm and the blood had not congealed, proving that the murderer must have gone just as the constable was approaching.  Watkins sent for doctors, and while waiting roused up Policeman Pearce, and the two taking courage together threw the light of their lamps on the corpse, which Watkins had not dared to do.  It is not to be wondered at that the policeman has been too ill all day to answer questions.The womans throat was cut from ear to ear and half the way round the head.  Her clothes had been raised up to the chest, and the body had been completely cut open from the pelvis to the chest.  The flaps of flesh were turned back, revealing the intestines.  In addition, a portion of the right ear was cut off and the nose was slashed half-way through.  The face was also slashed and cut in a most brutal fashion, and a portion of the intestines was placed in the gash around the neck.Several doctors arrived and examined the body.  They found a prodigious quantity of blood, which had flowed chiefly from the throat, but the murderer had so carefully avoided it that not a single footmark could be traced.  The body was removed to the mortuary, where a careful post-mortem examination took place.Such is the story of murder and mystery that now not only holds the attention of all England, but the entire civilized world.The Lord Mayor of London has offered a reward of £500 for the arrest of the perpetrator of the Whitechapel murders.  Dr. Henry Forbes Winslow, Sir Risdon Bennett and other medical experts are more than ever convinced that the murderer is a homicidal lunatic.STILL ANOTHER.The Mutilated Corpse of a Woman Found in a London Vault.LONDON, Oct. 2.-The corpse of a woman was today found in a vault on the site of the projected opera house on the Thames embankment, near the Houses of Parliament.The head and arm had been severed from the body, and the arm is missing.  The body was in an advanced state of decomposition.  The murder must have been committed weeks ago."

It was found not many hours after the violence had been done.The murder had been committed in the woman's own room.News of the discovery spread rapidly after it was once given out, and in a short time the vicinity was thronged with excited and morbidly curious people.The police authorities took charge of the body and the house at once after the fact of the murder became known to them.  They brought into use bloodhounds, which were lately tested for the purpose of hunting own the Whitechapel murderer in hope that the brutes could catch the scent and follow up the trail of the assassin.The Lord Mayor's parade made an emergency which called a great portion of the police force to special duty in controlling the crowds in the streets.  Hence the rigid patrol which has been kept up in the Whitechapel district was somewhat relaxed.This gave the murderer his opportunity, which he was not slow to seize.He is evidently more vigilant than the police, and has the advantage that he can study their movements without being himself subject to espionage.The present victim is the eighth who has fallen before the Whitechapel fiend.The fourth one was found in Hamburg street, not far from the location of this one, and at the time she was discovered there was written on the wall near the body the legend:""Fifteen before I surrender.""According to this, seven more lives are yet to be taken, and from the success which has thus far attended the murderer's operations, it seems entirely possible, perhaps probably, that he will be able to fulfil his horrible intentions.The appearance of the remains found last night was frightful, and the mutilation was even greater than in the previous cases.  The head had been severed and placed beneath one of the arms.  The ears and nose had been cut off.  The body had been disemboweled and the flesh was torn from the thighs.  The womb and other organs were missing.  The skin had been torn off the forehead and cheeks.  One hand had been pushed into the stomach.The victim, like all the others, was a lewd woman.  She was married, and her husband was a porter.  They had lived together at spasmodic intervals.  Her name is believed to have been Lizzie Fisher, but to most of the habitués of the haunts she visited she was known as Mary Jane.She had a room in the house where she was murdered.  She carried a latch key, and no one knows at what hour she entered the house last night, and probably no one saw the man who accompanied her.  Therefore it is hardly likely that he will ever be identified.He might easily have left the house at any time between 1 and 6 o'clock this morning without attracting attention.  The doctors who have examined the remains refuse to make any statement until the inquest is held.Three bloodhounds belonging to private citizens were taken to the place where the body lies and placed on the scent of the murderer, but they were unable to keep it for any great distance, and all hope to running the assassin down with their assistance will have to be abandoned."

Accurate circumstances of the affair are difficult to discover.  The police are as usual placing every obstacle in the way of the investigation of reporters, but all reports go to prove this a murder far surpassing in fiendish atrocity all the terrible crimes with which the east end of London has been familiarized within the past six months.A woman, 26 years old, by name Mary Jane Kelly, has lived for four months in the front room on the second floor of a house, up an alley known as Cartin's court.This poor woman was in service a short time ago, but since she came to reside in the court she had been recognized by neighbors as a person who like so many unfortunate members of her sex in the eastern end of the town, has managed to pass a wretched existence by the practice of immorality under the most degrading conditions.  Cartin's court faces a small square with a narrow entrance, and is surrounded by squalid lodging-houses with rooms to let to women of this unfortunate class.The Kelly woman is described as tall, and not bad looking, dark complexioned, and generally wearing an old black velvet jacket.  She was wearing this jacket this morning when about 8.15 she went down the court, jug in hand, and returned shortly afterwards with milk.  After breakfast she was next seen about 10 o'clock, when she went to a neighboring beer house, and stayed there drinking for half an hour.  This was the last seen of her alive.The woman was behind in rent and had been told by the landlord that she would be put out if she did not pay today.  She went on the streets last night to earn money to pay the rent, and it seems to be clearly established that she returned to her room with a man whoPassed the Night With HerNo one has been found who saw the man go in, but some neighbors heard him talking to the Kelly woman in her room, and heard her singing as though she were drunk.At 11 o'clock this morning a man named Bowyer, agent for the landlord, went ot Miss Kelly's room to collect the rent.  When he knocked at the door he received no answer.  Removing the curtain drawn across the window of the room and looking through the broken window pane, Mr. Bowyer saw the woman lying on the bed, on her back, stark naked, while marks of blood were visible all over the place.  He tried the handle of the door and found it locked, while the key had been removed from the lock.  Without going into the room Mr. Bowyer called the police, who promptly proceeded to conceal all the facts in the case.In less than two hours the doctors had the body in the morgue and were probing it precisely as they did the Mitre square victim.  They refused to give any details of the examination, but Dr. Gove, one of the physicians present, admitted that he had passed much of his life in dissecting rooms, but never saw such a horrible spectacle as the murdered woman. The man who was called in to identify the body gives the following descriptions, which seems to be reliable:The head was nearly severed from the shoulders and the face lacerated almost beyond recognition: the breasts both cut off and placed on the table: the heart and liver were between the woman's legs, the uterus was missing, and there seemed to be at least 40 cuts on the body, and big pieces of flesh literally stripped off and strewn on the floor.It is simply too hideous to describe.  There were no indications in this case of the hand skilled in the use of a knife.  The body is literally hacked to pieces, but there is no doubt at all but that it is the work of the person who has become known throughout the world as theWhitechapel Murderer.The mystery in this case is as deep as in the preceding crimes.  The fiend got away without leaving the slightest clew.  He chose his time well.  At the moment when Mr. Bowyer discovered the murdered body that gorgeous annual nuisance which goes by the name of the Lord Mayor's show, blocking the traffic of the great city for hours, was organizing near Mansion House, scarcely a mile away.  Nearly 3,000,000 people were packed in the streets between Mansion House and Trafalgar square, with nearly every policeman in the city braced as a barricade along the curb to keep them in order.  The rigid police patrol maintained in Whitechapel since the last double murder in October was removed for one day, and in that one day the assassin struck down another victim.It is scarcely necessary to say much about Mary Kelly.  She was a married woman who fell into dissolute ways, and was deserted by her husband.  She had a boy 11 years old, who was begging in the streets while the mother was murdered.  The woman had as a paramour a man who sells oranges in the streets, and on whom, as he could not be found, suspicion at once reverted.  But he turned up all right tonight, and fainted when he was shown the murdered woman's body.Like the sands that slowly filter through an hour glass when reversed, the great throng on the streets who had been observing the new Lord Mayor found their way into Whitechapel.  When the news of the murder spread about every heard was filled with horror.  When was this to end?  How long would this fiend in human form carve people to pieces under the noses of the police and mock their feeble efforts to catch him?The London police are not allowed to club a crowd into submission as are American police, unless an absolute riot is imminent, but the indignation and excitement was great in Whitechapel today.  It was necessary for them to use harsh measures.  Profiting by former blunders the police called a photographer to take a picture of the room before the body was removed from it.  This gives rise to a report that bloodyHandwriting Was on the Wall.though three or four people who were allowed to enter the room say they did not observe it, but possibly they were too excited to notice details.A young girl who knew the murdered woman well, says that about 10 last night she met her, and that she had no money.  She said she could not get any.  She would never go out any more, but would do away with herself.  Soon after they parted, and the man, who is described as respectably dressed, came up and spoke to the murdered woman and offered her money.  The man then accompanied the woman to her lodgings.The little boy was removed from the room and taken to a neighbor's house.  The boy has been found and corroborates this, but says he cannot remember the man's face.Another curious circumstance is worth mentioning.  The murder was not made known until 12 o'clock.  Mrs. Paumier, who seems to be a credible person, sells walnuts in Sandys row, near the scene of the murder.  She states that at 11 o'clock today a respectably dressed man carrying a black bag came up to her and began talking about the murder.  He wanted to know everything about it. He did not buy any walnuts, and, after standing a few minutes, went away.  Mrs. Paumier describes him as about 30 years old, 5 feet six inches in height.  He wore a checked pair of trousers and a black coat.Several girls in the neighborhood say the same man accosted them, and they chafled him.  When they asked him what he had in the black bag he said: ""Something that ladies don't like.""  This is all that is known of him.If the police have further information they carefully conceal it, but there is no reason to believe that they have.WHERE CRIME STALKS.Whitechapel and Its Chapter of HorrorsNew York, Nov. 9.-The World tomorrow will publish the following:London, Oct. 30.-The word ""Whitechapel"" has passed as a verb into the vocabulary of the criminal classes.  No less than a dozen women of the streets have complained of an assailant in the police courts this week that he had threatened to ""Whitechapel"" them.  Within a few days the word has assumed a horrible significance.The Whitechapel murders have startled the whole world.  An obscure locality in a great metropolis, the border line between Povertyville and the affluent splendor of the West End, is forced into a lurid glare of publicity.  Mysterious murders are the topic of the day.  Politics and everything else that newspapers usually print, and the public reads about, are wiped out in a smudge of blood.Next to ""Who is the murderer?"" people are asking, ""What and where is Whitechapel?""  What is usually called the Whitechapel district is about equivalent in territory to the east side of New York city from Houston street to Frankfort street, bounded on the west by the Bowery and Chatham street.  There are worse slums in London than Whitechapel, just as there are worse slums in New York than are to be found in the territory I have indicated.  Through this populous region the Whitechapel road runs obliquely much as Broadway runs through New York city.  This thoroughfare is the Bowery of London, but twice as big, thrice as wicked, and four times the number of people pushing and crowding through it after nightfall.The dissolute and vicious of all climes congregate there: black ""Lascar"" sailors from India crazed with rum; gay girls from Paris, who had to leave that city or go to prison for purification; men and women who have ""done their term"" in the prisons; others who have escaped and never stir out fo (sic) the daylight; thieves and thugs, housebreakers and harlots - there they all are.The sky is aglow with the glare of splendid gin palaces, cheap theatres and the smoking naptha lamps of thousands of street vendors.  You may see the reflection of it for miles, but they are not all wicked people that you see in Whitechapel at night.  It is the shopping street of the respectable laborer and his wife.It is one of the great trade arteries of the metropolis, one of the unique thoroughfares in the world.  Whitechapel is cleaner than the territory I have referred to on the east side of New York.  It is not nearly so dilapidated as the Communists' quarter of Paris, but you will find more squalid, ragged children there, more half-dressed wretched looking men and women than you can scrape up in New York and Paris put together.It is the loose women of Whitechapel that make it one of the strangest and saddest spectacles in Christendom.  Hundreds upon hundreds of these forlorn creatures tramp the streetsFrom Dark Till Dawn.They have no home.  It is seldom that they even sleep two nights under the same roof.  These unfortunates ply their vocation in the open streets, in the hallways of lodging-houses and in the sheltered ""squares,"" where they can gain privacy.  In bitterest weather they roam houseless, creeping in stairways to sleep, huddling in untenanted cellars, packed close to one another for warmth.Until these murders began no policeman disturbed them.  So long as they did not quarrel they were allowed to forget their misery in slumber.  All that is changed now.  The policemen are ordered to rout the unfortunate creatures out and they tramp about all night and all next day till they can get fourpence to hire a bed.  While looking up the murders for the World I was asked for a penny by one girl not 17 years old, who declared she had not been able to find a place to sleep undisturbed, for 48 hours, and she looked it.  They live and breathe in a putrid atmosphere of pitiable misery and unspeakable vice.Here is what a young woman who is doing missionary work among the people says: ""The terrible difficulty we have to encounter is that of trying to find them work.  We had last year a very touching case of a woman who seemed sincerely  desirous of mending her ways, but who was over the age at which they are usually admitted to homes.  After a great deal of difficulty we found an opening for her, and she went to the home, but some of these places, I am afraid, are managed too rigorously, and the matrons are sometimes wanting in sympathy with the inmates, who find it extremely difficult to submit to the discipline.  It was the case with this woman; she found the discipline of this place more than she could endure, and she left; but she came to us again and still seemed sick and weary of the wretched life she led.  If she could find something to do she really would try, but of the - home - she seemed to have a positive horror.  We could find her no work, and she tried charing and washing, and I believe did her earnest best to maintain herself that way.  But it was gradual starvation.  Often we found she was whole days without food, and those she lived with say that only at the last extremity did she allow herself to be drawn again to her old course.  I'm afraid, however, she drifted back but still she would come to our meetings, and would borrow from our library books that you would never imagine she would care to read.  She came to a meeting one Tuesday night and scarcely able to stand, and on Thursday she died.""The woman who looks after these mission rooms,"" continued the speaker, ""was another from the same class, and she used to be an associate of the poor creatures murdered in Berners street.  She saw her only last Thursday and she - that is, the murdered woman - said then that she felt she was coming to some bad end.""The excitement and fear of Whitechapel people since the two last murders I will not attempt to describe.  They know well the opportunities that the criminal has for keeping from the clutches of the police, and that if he is captured at all it will probably be in the act ofButchering Another Victim.Which of them will it be?  Until the bodies were identified the city mortuary was surrounded all day by people, attracted there by some horrible fascination, hoping to get a look at the mutilated bodies within.  It was wise of the police to make this number as small as possible.  No one who saw those victims will ever forget them.The first of the six Whitechapel murders dates back to April 3, when Emma Elizabeth Smith was found dead in a yard near Osborne street with a large hole in her abdomen, made by a sharp iron stake or some similar instrument.  There was nothing of the horrifying mutilation of the body which has made the five subsequent murders world-famous in the annals of crime.  Evil deeds are common enough in the slums of London, and this was a woman of the street, killed, it was presumed, by a jealous lover or an angry husband.  The public read that the ""affair was in the hands of the police,"" and promptly forgot it.It is not believed that this murder had any connection with the subsequent horrors committed by the unknown spoken of as the ""maniac murderer.""  Polly Nicols, another vagrant of the streets, was the first victim to the shocking brutality of this fiend.  At 3.45 on the morning of Aug. 31 Policeman John O'Neil was walking through Bucks row, Whitechapel, when he saw what he thought was a woman asleep on the pavement.  He prodded her with his foot and said, ""Come, old girl, you can't sleep here.""The woman never moved, and he stooped down to turn her over to get a look at her face; his hands were bathed in warm blood.  He had passed the same spot not 15 minutes before, and a most atrocious murder had been committed while he had been gone.  If there had been a cry for help or a scuffle for life he could scarcely have helped hearing the whole length of his beat.  Three men working in a slaughterhouse near by never heard a sound.The woman's head was nearly severed back to the vertebra, which was also slightly injured.  One gash under the left ear reached nearly to the center of her throat; another cut starting from the right ear, was almost as long.  The woman's skirts were torn from her body and her abdomen ripped open so that the bowels protruded.  One cut, extending from the womb to the breast bone, was such as only a strong man skilled in the use of a knife could have made.  The victim's front teeth were knocked out and her face much bruised, while her hands gave evidence that she hadStruggled Desperately for Life.When Policeman O'Neil was questioned closely he recollected that the body was lying on its back, with outstretched hands, as though it had been placed where it was found.  There are three or four low houses close by, and the theory was suggested that the woman was murdered in one of them and then carried into the street.Such a crime could scarcely be carried out without leaving traces of blood, and though the houses were carefully searched nothing of the kind was found.The keeper of a lodging-house near by remembered Polly coming to him a few hours before she was murdered to get a bed.  She had been drinking, but was not drunk.  She had not the fourpence to pay for a bed, and he would not let her have it.  The poor women went into the street to earn her ""doss"" as she had done scores of times before.  No one has been found who saw her alive after that.A gateman was on duty all night at the crossing of the Great Eastern railway, scarcely 60 yards from where her body was found, but he heard no screams.Very early on the morning of Aug. 7, John Reeves, living at 37 George Hayward buildings, Whitechapel, was coming down stairs to go to work.  The George Hayward buildings are divided into tenements of three and four rooms each all occupied by working people.  On the first floor landing Reeves found the body of a woman in a pool of blood.  She had been stabbed in 39 places with a sharp pointed instrument, probably a bayonet.  The walls of the houses are thin, and ordinary conversation on the lower landing can easily be heard in the rooms up stairs.  Yet no one in the house, not even four people sleeping 12 feet away from where the body was soaking in blood, head any unusual noise that night.  Elizabeth Mahony, who lived in the house, did not get home until 2 o'clock in the morning and the body was not there then.  The murdered woman was identified as Martha Tabram.  Another outcast was buried and forgotten.In less than a week there was another murder, evidently by the same hand, only the fiendish brutality to the victim was worse.  This time, too, it was a prostitute.  Annie Chapman was once the wife of a well-to-do veterinary surgeon living at Windsor.  Drink and immorality separated her from her husband, who allowed her 10 shillings a week to live on.  He died, the allowance ceased and the poor woman joined the innumerableArmy of Street Walkers.No. 29 Hanbury street, Spitalfields, is a tenement house, let out to many families, most of whom keep lodgers.  In this house, os (sic) in most houses of its class, there is no lock to the front door.  Anybody can pass into the hall from the street.  For protection the tenants lock the doors opening into the landings.  There is a large yard in the rear of these tenement houses, and it is a common custom for women of the street to take men there for privacy.  Beyond doubt this was the case with Annie Chapman.  Like the woman Nicols, she had not money to pay for her bed.  She said to the lodging-house keeper:""Save a bed for me: I shan't be long.""John Davies, a carman, lives at 29 Hanbury street.  He was not well the night of the murder and woke at 3 a.m.  At 5 or shortly after he went down stairs to the back yard.  There was nobody there then.  At about 5.40 he went to the yard again.  When he reached the lower hall he noticed that the back door was closed and the front door was wide open.  When he opened the back door he saw Annie Chapman's bleeding body at the foot of the steps.  Davies had been lying awake in bed, and had heard no scream or cry for help.  He did hear footsteps in the hallway, but that was nothing unusual, for some people in the house had to go to work at 6 o'clock.The murder had been committed inside of 40 minutes, and not one of the 500 people within sound of a woman's voice had heard even a groan.  Made bold by the failure of the police to catch him, or even get on his track, the murdererCarved This Victimto his hearts' content.  The physician who examined the body asked to be spared relating the circumstances to the coroner's jury.Mrs. Burridge, a shopkeeper in Black Friar road, died in a fit while reading an account of the horror in a newspaper.  Though circumstances show that the murderer had less than 40 minutes at his disposal there was no sign of haste about his work.  He cut up his victim as deliberately and skillfully as a surgeon operates on a cadaver at the dissecting table.  He killed her as he did the other women by almost cutting her head from her shoulders, and then proceeded to disembowel her, attaching a portion of the intestines to her neck.  The uterus he cut out and carried away.The panic created by this piece of butchery and the increased vigilance of the police seemed to have frightened the murderer off, but the morning of Sept. 30 he sallied forth again.  At 1 o'clock he met Elizabeth Stride on Berner street and cut her throat.  The fact that the body was not otherwise mutilated made it possible that it was not the work of the same assassin.  But the doctors who have examined the wounds in the throat believe that it is.Here is a physician's description of the wound: There was a clean-cut incision on the neck.  It was six inches in length and commenced 2 ½ inches in a straight line below the angle of the jaw, three-quarters of an inch over an undivided muscle, and then, becoming deeper, dividing the sheath.  The cut was very clean and deviated a little downward.  The artery and other vessels contained in the sheath were all cut through.  The cut through the tissues on the right side was more superficial and sailed off to about two inches below the right angle of the jaw.  The deep vessels on that side were uninjured.From this it was evident that the hemorrhage was caused through the partial severance of the left carotid artery.Berner street is a badly-lighted thoroughfare, inhabited by tolerably respectable people.  The Workmen's International Educational Club has a building there.  There is a stable in the rear of it, shut off from the street by two stout wooden gates.  There is a small door in one gate fastened with a latch.The probability is that the murderer got the woman just inside the door, cut her throat, and was frightened by noise made by people moving about in the club-room.  There were any number of people astir in the neighborhood when Elizabeth Stride's life was taken, but no one heard a sound.  The steward of the club-rooms found the body just inside the wooden gate when he went there after 1 o'clock Sunday morning.  The body was still warm and the blood was trickling under the gate, down the pavement to the gutter.  The steward called some of the members in the club who were simplyStaggered by the Sight.One man said that he had closed the gate himself when he passed through the yard 20 minutes previous.  The woman was identified.  Her life story is a sad one, but there are thousands in London and in New York, too, for that manner.Meanwhile, to follow the murderer.  While the police were carrying the body of Elizabeth Stride to the dead house, he was knifing another woman 10 minutes' walk from the spot.  Officer Watkins, who covered that beat that Sunday night, is considered one of the most reliable men on the force.  He talks like a shrewd, careful fellow.  At 1.30 Sunday morning he walked through Mitre square.  Two street lamps were burning there and three windows in a large warehouse were ablaze with light.  The policeman could see the watchman of the warehouse reading within.  All was quiet.  Exactly 15 minutes later the policeman passed that way again.  His feet slipped in the blood of another murdered woman.  The policeman could have heard a woman's shriek from one end of his beat to the other, but he did not hear one that night.  Not a sound disturbed the watchman in the warehouse.  Just inside the railings, not 20 feet from the dead body, an ex-policeman lived with his family,and the windows of their bedrooms faced the square.  No cry for help disturbed their slumber.  In this case again the murderer had time to mutilate his victim unmolested.  Her throat was cut first, of course, then the assassin's knife was thrust into the upper part of the abdomen and drawn completely down, ripping open the stomach and exposing the intestines.  In addition there was another deep cut across the abdomen, and the left kidney have been carefully taken out.  It was the work, so a competent physician thinks, of a man skilled in anatomy, sure in his stroke with the knife, and steady of nerve.  This kidney was taken away by the murderer, a part of the uterus with ligament attached was taken away also, the face was horribly disfigured.  A part of the right ear had been taken off, and a deep gash extended across the right cheek, almost to the nose or rather the place where the nose ought to have been, for that was cut off too.  This woman was identified as Catharine Eddowes, a street hawker, living with a man named Kelly.  If the day's business was bad, as was often the case, she tried to make a little moneyIn the Slums at Night.On Oct. 2 another mutilated body of a woman was discovered, and this crime is attributed by some to the Whitechapel murderer.  It was found in an open vault, on the site of the projected Grand Opera house, within a stone's throw of the Grand and Metropole hotels, and within sight of police headquarters at Scotland Yard.  The body was in an advanced state of decomposition, and had been subjected to mutilation similar in fiendish ingenuity to those inflicted on the Whitechapel victims.  The head and arms had been separated from the body, the abdomen cut vertically and the viscera exposed.  The monster evidently had more time and was able to perform his terrible task with greater leisure.  He had wrapped up the remains and corded them.  One arm was missing.  A month before a woman's arm had been found floating in the Thames at Pimlico, and this is believed to be the missing member.The locality is one of the busiest and wealthiest parts of London, and is thronged with thousands of people, but at night is somewhat deserted, and the Thames embankment, with its brilliant electric lights and heavy shadows, is considered one of the most dangerous spots of all London after 10 p.m.Sir Charles Warren, forced to say something in response to the frantic appeals for prompt and effective action made to him, said:""Statistics show that London, in comparison to its population is the safest city in the world to live in.""It is due to the police to say that their failure to catch the criminal has not been wholly due to inactivity.  This is especially true of the ""city"" force.  Each organization is working independently of the other, according to its own methods.  The investigation of the numerous slaughter houses in the district has been most thorough.  Every one in the East End and some others have practically been turned inside out.  The proprietors and managers have in most cases heartily co-operated with the police.  Every policeman has been personally ""pumped.""  Each man has been called upon to give an account of himself and his whereabouts, not only on Saturday night, Sept. 29, but during the entire period over which the series of crimes extends.  Every suspicious circumstance is made a note of, and no one to whom the slightest suspicion attaches is lost sight of until the suspicion is completely allayed.  Nor has the man's own word been accepted as conclusive.  Each man has been asked if he knows of any one who has not been regular at his work or has played tricks on the timekeeper, for the time book in each establishment plays an important part of the investigation.  More than all this, in some cases all men who can write have been called upon to make a statement in writing and sign their names so that any possible question of handwriting may be more easily compared.The same thoroughness has characterized what has been done in the lodging-houses.  Deputies were required to make a showing of their regular lodgers, to point out their habits, their peculiarities and their associates, and to furnish descriptions of all causal visitors who hadAttracted Special Attention.Frequenters of lodging-houses have been interviewed by hundreds, and detectives have been scattered all over the district disguised as men ""down on their luck.""  In the hope of the picking up some information; but the police have pretty well made up their minds that the man they want is not to be found through the lodging-house channel.The fact that so many of the victims were themselves frequenters of these caravansaries has quickened their instincts and aroused the spirit of the class, and it would be almost impossible for a murderer to be among them without some one giving him away.The attention that has been paid to the hospitals has been quite as close, but the police have not always found the hospital authorities too eager to assist them.  The ethics of medical etiquette appear to stand in the way of full and free investigation among medical students, at least, for they are slow to tell what they know or suspect when it may affect one of their number.  One police inspector said that he supposed there was over a hundred men who were being individually shadowed in his district alone, and if the same system is in vogue all over the East End, the number of detectives on the job must be something enormous.  There is not a vacant building in the East End that has not been thoroughly searched, lest it might afford a hiding place for the murderer, and in at least tow instances the drain pipes have been taken up for a long distance where suspicious matter was thought to have been deposited.Every vessel that has left the harbor since the commission of the last crime has been thoroughly overhauled, the work houses have been visited for the examination of all new inmates, and even the prison authorities have been enlisted in the cause for the sake of keeping a close eye on prisoners who may have been glad to get put away for a time for trivial offences.  It is estimated, roughly speaking, that there are at least 500 men engaged in these investigations who are not police officers, but who are directly instructed by the police officials.  The arrests so far are legion.Well, at this writing no one is under arrest; all the men locked up on suspicion and on delirium tremens confessions have been discharged.  A man from New York was among the number.  He came into the World office afterward and wanted it explained that he was ""on a lark.""  Well, he had his fun, and from the police court evidence he deserved all the unsavory publicity he got.  But so far it has all amounted to nothing.  Whether it will do so before this letter reaches the World looks very doubtful now.  BAFFLED.London Detectives at Their Wits' End.Whitechapel Fiend Still at LargeCharacteristics That Mark His Conduct.No Motive Hit Upon As Yet.Save That His Victim Sang ""Sweet Violets,""After Which No Further Sound was Heard.Pardon Offered any Accomplice Turning State's Evidence.London, Nov. 10.-The excitement here this morning over the lengthening series of Whitechapel atrocities is more intense than ever.  The papers are having enormous sales, though they contain little besides speculation and rumors.  Beyond the broad facts of this ninth atrocity, the police are endeavoring to keep everything secret.The one question in everybody's mind is, Can the murderer of Mary Jane McCarthy or Kelly be found?This is the problem before the London police, and the impression prevails that it will be answered negatively.  But if so public indignation is likely to culminate in an overturning of the present police authorities.Yet the Whitechapel monster left more tracks behind him in this than in any other previous butchery.  He was seen by several persons.As he was entering the small court which led to the dirty room where the crime was committed, both the man and Mary Jane stopped and laughed at a large poster which offers £100 reward for the Whitechapel murderer.  A number of people who live in a lodging-house across the way noted the incident, and give this description of the man: About 30 years old, 5 feet 6 inches tall, wore speckled trousers and a black coat and respectable in appearance.A Mrs. Paumier, who sells walnuts in Sandys row, gives a similar description of a man who talked with her about the murder at 11 o'clock yesterday.  He bought no walnuts, but lingered around the locality for some time.  In his left hand he carried a black bag.  He accosted several girls in the neighborhood, and when asked by them what he carried in the bag, replied in a sarcastic tone:""Something the Ladies Don't Like.""""Fair Emma,"" as she was known to the denizens of Commercial street, was between 26 and 30 years of age.  Her small boy has recently been living with some friendly neighbors.  Thursday night, soon after midnight, she came into Dorset street, accompanied by a man.  They turned out of the street into Miller's court.  Once in the woman's room, persons in the house heard her singing ""Sweet Violets"" in a drunken voice.  No sound was detected from the room thereafter until the horribly mutilated body was discovered yesterday by the landlord, who called to collect his rent.Yet here are definite facts for the police to work upon.  It is Sir Charles Warren's opportunity to demonstrate the efficiency or inefficiency of himself and his subordinates.The bloodhounds put upon the murderer's track proved a failure.  The police are baffled and helpless as before.  The keenest detectives int eh force, who have been on the watch since the last murder, are unable to find a clew or even form a theory.As on previous occasions, in the absence of any indications, a drag-net has been thrown over the metropolis, and all the men who can be spared are searching every railway station, public house, evil resort and hole and corner, not only in the East End, but throughout the city.There is no doubt that this and the eight other butcheries which preceded it were perpetrated by one and the same man, who decoys or suffers himself to appear to be decoyed into a safe place; that the murder is instantaneous, no warning being given the victim, nor chance to cry for help, no time to struggle for life; thatThe Mutilation of the Remainsis accomplished at such leisure as the murderer may have, and it is noted that the ingenuity of his fiendish devices is in proportion to the time in each case which he probably had at his disposal; that he leaves no mark behind except upon the bodies of his victims; that even the money and jewelry have been untouched, and that he enters and leaves a house without making a noise or attracting the slightest attention, as in the last case, when people were up or awake all night in the building and heard nothing remarkable.He waits, watches his chances, secures his prey, seizes the opportunity, applies the knife probably at the instant when the unresisting victim is most off her guard, finishes the awful work and vanishes into the void of London.The only defence made by Sir Chas. Warren of the police for their failure to discover the assassin is that both parties conspire, as it were, to prevent detection by shrouding their movements in darkness and secrecy.The people of London are exasperated beyond measure at the repetition of these atrocities.  Demands for the offer of a large reward are again made upon Home Secretary Matthews.The panic in Whitechapel and Spitalfields is revived.  The outcasts who formerly thronged the streets cower in their lodgings in a state of abject terror.  Their traffic has been stopped as if a pestilence were abroad.Not a woman could be seen on the streets last night in the infected quarters.  The police have again been doubled.  Every doubtful house is under espionage, and every suspicious stranger is closely watched.General Warren, chief of the metropolitan police, has issued a proclamation offering a free pardon to any accomplice the Whitechapel murderer may have, provided he will give information which will lead to the murderer's apprehension.  It is learned that the woman whose mutilated body was found in the Dorset street house yesterday was a native of Limerick, Ire.  She migrated to Wales, where she married a collier, who was subsequently killed by an explosion.  After that she drifted to London."
131,index/boston_daily_globe_18881210.txt,boston_daily_globe,1888-12-10,"Boston Daily GlobeMonday, 10 December 1888""SLUMMING"" Scenes of Vice, Poverty, and Crime.Witnessed at Night by a Lady Newspaper Correspondent. Visiting the Scenes of the Late Whitechapel Tragedies. London., Dec 1. - ""Slumming."" Curious term, no doubt to you on the other side of the water, but one which London papers have universally adopted as exactly ""fitting the case."" For the past two years, and especially during the cold months of winter, the lady members of many of our aristocratic families of Park Lane and Belgravia have indulged in the craze of ""slumming."" Using their persuasive eloquence upon the male members of their families to accompany them, they have courageously visited, during the day, many of the poorest localities and slums of our great metropolis, seeing with their own eyes the abject poverty of their fellow-citizens and relieving the wants of the poor personally and to such an extent that their visits have indeed been ""Angel's visits,"" undoubtedly saving many a poor wretch from starvation and perhaps death. At one tenement a few loaves of bread for a starving family, at another an order for a hundredweight of coal, tea, sugar, flour, or whatever they thought would best serve the necessities of the case, these kind and humane ladies have been welcome visitors indeed.None, however, have dared to enter those terrible dens of infamy and crime so common in the district, now so well known throughout England, and I may say the civilized world - Whitechapel - up to the last few weeks, when that enterprising paper published by Sir William Christopher Leng, the Sheffield Telegraph, commissioned its lady correspondent to make a tour at night of the famous locality, accompanied by a detective, and write for its columns her impressions and ocular demonstration of the state of affairs existing there.The lady, who is well known and who ranks high in the estimation of her brother and sister scribblers, accompanied by a detective as equally well known, has made the tour, and the result of her observations and graphic description of the scenes she witnessed in her visit have been printed. Her pictures of vice, misery, poverty and crime are so vivid and lifelike that, combined with the pluck she has shown in her hazardous undertakings, she has earned the highest praise and esteem of her fellow laborers. I send you her story, as she tells it in her own words, accompanied with a map of the Whitechapel district, so that your readers can see at a glance the streets and spots where the seven terrible tragedies have taken place.SLUMMING  WHITECHAPEL.Sights and Scenes Witnessed During a Tour by Night.Perhaps there is no locality in the United Kingdom which at the present time is so notorious as Whitechapel. The horrible tragedies so recently enacted there in such rapid succession have sent a thrill of indignant fear throughout England, while in the neighborhood itself the panic still lasts, and will do so as long as the bloodthirsty monster remains unknown and uncaptured.After the dreadful crimes so placidly perpetrated in Mitre Square and Berners [sic] street, I conceived an ardent desire to visit and see for myself the region of a civilized city that seems to be given up to horrors unmentionable.The thing that puzzled me was how to go. Night is the best time, but it is hardly the place where a stranger would care to go to alone, and in a great measure unprotected.I mentioned the difficulty to a friend of mine, Inspector R--- of the city police.""It is not a nice neighborhood,"" he said thoughtfully, ""and it is of no use going there unless you know your way about, or else you stand a tidy chance of getting knocked on your head, or returning minus your watch and chain.""I looked rather glum, and he went on to remark ""that he would have been pleased to accompany me only he was leaving town the next day on particular business.""""Where do you want to go?"" he asked.""Well,"" I replied, ""I want to go to Mitre square, Buck's row, Berners Street, and Hanbury street and just see for myself what class of people really do live there.""""I can manage that for you,"" he said. ""One of our men, Mr. B----, is thoroughly efficient and highly respectable and intelligent officer, and he can go round with you.""I thanked the worthy inspector, who introduced me to Mr. B----, a tall, muscular and rather handsome man, and an arrangement was made there and then that I should meet the officer on the next night by the Law Courts.The next evening we met at the appointed place, my escort looking very big and stalwart in his civilian dress, and I, clad in the darkest and least conspicuous of clothes.It was a lovely night, clear and cold, the blue heavens all aglow with myriads of stars. The Strand was busy as only the Strand can be.We hailed a 'bus, and soon we left the glare and bustle of the Strand and Fleet Street far behind. At Leadenhall street we got down and just at the end of that street and Whitechapel road is a narrow street which leads into Mitre square.Although Mitre square is respectable, it affords facilities for crime. At night it is comparatively deserted, and, moreover, is badly lit, the corners being completely enveloped in gloom, and another thing is that there are few thoroughfares leading in and out of the square.The next place we visited was Berners street, and to get there we had to cross Whitechapel road and go down Commercial street [sic]. The bustle and noise was most grateful after the fearful hush of Mitre square: there were quantities of men and women, but what men and women were they? As we got near to Berners street, Mr. B---- asked me ""if I felt frightened?"" I laughed and replied in the negative, and then he showed me with a certain amount of satisfaction that he was provided with his whistle andA Thick, Heavy Walking Stick.In another few minutes we were in what my companion tersely described as a beastly locality. A long, ill-paved, narrow, badly-lit street. The lamps are few and far between, and show a flickering, sickly, yellow light.After the glare of Whitechapel road, the darkness seems trebly bad. The houses are small and squalid, and teeming with life. Late as it is, one must walk carefully for fear of falling over half-naked infants, who crawl about the broken pavements.Soon we leave the groups of horrible children behind and the thoroughfare looks deserted, and is so quiet that our footsteps ring out startlingly distinct on the still night air.We cross over, and Mr. B---- points out a door apparently leading into a house, but when he pushes it open I see to my astonishment that it encloses a court, or narrow alley.I peep down it, and as well as I can see in the blackness - for there is no lamp in the entry - I notice that there are houses at each side. Filthy, ramshackle cottages, evidently let out in tenements, for they seem swarming with human beings.A man half dressed, unshaven, and unspeakably brutal looking, emerges from one of the houses. He is short and thick set, one eye is blackened, and a strip of filthy plaster adorns his left cheek. He is clad in fustian trousers and a ragged blue shirt, a wisp of rag is twisted round his neck, with the end of which he wipes his mouth preparatory to speaking. When he does speak it is to gently inquire in a hoarse voice: ""What the b----- h--- we ----- ------- ------ are doing?""The expletives roll easily off his tongue, and in the midst of his tirade he catches sight of my companion, who is keeping his blue eyes fixed sternly on his face.The effect is magical, for instantly stops his eloquence, and he disappears into the interior. In his absence we make our exit.""You see"", says Mr. B----, ""there are any amount of these alleys about, and while the police are patrolling the street the Lord only knows what goes on in the courts that branch from the man thoroughfare.""For instance we passed a couple of constables a few minutes ago; well, they are not able to visit and properly inspect every alley in Berners street. Why, we should want at least a score of men for that duty alone. Look how dark the entries are. If a murder were committed in the street the murderer could easily escape observation by staying in one of the alleys till the first hue and cry was over, and then he could mix with the crowd and get off.""By this time we have got to a building which Mr. B---- informs me is the club rendered notorious by being so near the scene ofThe Berners Street Tragedy, whilst opposite is a stone block which is a board school. Next to the club is a pair of high wooden gates which open inwards into the stable yard.On the right is the club, the windows of which are all lit up, and further on is the side door. Opposite are three small whitewashed cottages. The place is so narrow that if the hapless victim had made the least noise it must have been heard, despite the singing and merriment that were going on in the club.A girl of about 14, barefooted and bareheaded, with a white, frightened face and sharp furtive eyes comes out of one of the houses. She starts a little when she sees us standing, and then comes across to me.""The woman was found there,"" she says, with infinite gusto smacking her lips at the chance of repeating the tale of horror to an interesting listener. ""'er head was on that short stone post, and 'er legs was just over the iron railings, and the blood and gore was all down there,"" and she pointed out the various spots mentioned with great relish.""Do you live here?"" we asked.""Yes, sir, in the second cottage,"" she answered.""And did you not hear anything?"" queried Mr. B-----.""Not a sound, sir."" says the girl, earnestly, ""and nobody else down here heard nothing neither. You know, sir, I think that""But we were fated never to hear what the girl thinks, for a voice calls out ""Lizer!"" and she promptly vanished into the cottage.Occasionally we meet a few brawny fellows dressed in corduroys, who peer at us curiously as they slouch along in an aimless sort of manner. Mr. B---- glances at them keenly, and sometimes he smiles a little as we pass on; afterwards he tells me that they are detectives.We Reach Bucks Row,and I may at once admit that I was agreeably surprised by it. The street is fairly wide, well paved, and not badly lit. The houses are small, but the majority are clean and respectable looking, and seem to be inhabited by the hard working poor. In fact, it is a very superior locality to Berners street.The actual spot of the tragedy, although rather in the shade, is still open. There is a house with green shutters. Next to it is a pair of high wooden gates; slantingly opposite is another lamp. Between the lamp by the gate, lying in the road itself, was found the barbarously mutilated body of the second victim of the recent murders. To my mind this is the most mysterious crime of the lot, for it seems improbable that so ghastly an act could be perpetrated in a comparatively well-lit, thickly populated street like this, without some trace of the assassin being found, or some clew to his whereabouts being discovered.A door is open of one of the houses and it gives us an opportunity of seeing an interior so scrupulously clean, so bright and cheerful, that the remembrance of the black deed that took place outside seems to be even yet more horrible.We have seen all there is to see. We leave Buck's row on our way to Hanbury street.There is one exceedingly disagreeable feature of all these localities that deserves mention, and yet can necessarily be only lightly touched upon, and that is that the men and women, particularly the former, have not the least knowledge of common decency.Their ignorance or wilful defiance of the most ordinary rules of decorum is apt to prove both embarrassing and uncomfortable to ordinary mortals who still think that modesty and decency exist even in the far East. The sights that I saw can better be imagined than described; indeed, a description would be peculiarly offensive, and I must admit that the women were nearly as great offenders as the men.Hanbury Streetis a very different locality to any we have yet been in. It is long and narrow, and unevenly paved. The houses are rather high, the majority dirty, and the whole lot swarming with inhabitants.I here remarked to Mr. B---- ""that the place is not as bad as I thought.""He tells me that we are not yet in the thick of it, and he begs me to keep close to him.I soon find out that I have been too hasty in giving an opinion, for the neighborhood and the people are vile. So much we see, I with horror distended eyes, my companion with the placidity born of intimate knowledge of these slums, so much that dare not be written and can only be spoken of in whispers.The foreign element predominates. Villainous-looking Poles, ruffianly Germans, starving Russians, with the scum of half a dozen other nations all live or rather exist about here. They speak some incomprehensible jargon, they manage to find some means of earning a livelihood. I believe that they are quiet and inoffensive if left to themselves, but it is easy to see that they are looked upon with ill-concealed aversion and distrust.I quite credit Mr. B-----'s statement that if the murderer was found to be a foreigner, all the police in London would be powerless to stay the persecution that the rest would be subjected to, in fact, they would beHounded out of Whitechapel.A man who has been glancing at us wolfishly darts forward to make a grab at the handkerchief I hold in my hand.""Ah would you,"" says Mr. B-------, and the would-be thief makes off.I laugh at the salutary effect that my companion produces.""They know me,"" he says; ""I have walked into one of the doss houses (lodging houses) after a man, found him there amongst a score of his pals and have marched him off quite comfortably. They have got no real pluck; why, the majority of them are miserable cowards. Besides, as they often tell me, ""We're not afrightened of you, but it's the clothes you wear that we are afraid of.""We are now near the scene of the murder; there are few shops, but any number of these common lodging-houses. The place is comparatively deserted, only a few unfortunates flitting by us, very likely seeking the wherewithal to pay for a night's shelter.On our left is a house with the legend ""Comfortable beds,"" written on a board outside. Opposite is the lodging-house from which the hapless victim of the Hanbury street tragedy was turned away to meet her death, because she had not the four pence to pay for her bed.The night is still young, so the birds of prey have not as yet returned to their noisome nests. While we stand we see several girls disappear down the various entries. One woman asks us for assistance. She say she has no money, and since the last two murders she has been afraid to go out and seek it.These woman make no secret of their calling, which they regard with callous indifference, but I cannot help thinking as we watch her go into the house opposite, that she and her class, if they could be persuaded to speak, could throw some light on the mysterious perpetrator of the crimes.The mist begins to fall in a steady melancholy drizzle, and the wind blows cold and raw. I shiver involuntarily, for the chill breeze seems to penetrate even my thick coat. The damp is surcharged with smuts and wherever they fall they leave a black smear.A Cripple is Sitting in a Doorway;he looks wolfish and starved; a hunk of dry bread, the rejected evidently of dogs, is lying in the gutter, and this he presently sees. He gives a low cry, and with the aid of his rough crutch, he hobbles towards it, his poor maimed leg working with excitement; he clutches at the bread eagerly, drags himself back to the step and commences to gnaw and tear at the crust, more like a wild animal than anything human.His enjoyment, however, is of short duration, for a long, yellow, thieving hand, belonging to a something that bears a faint resemblance to a woman, grasps him by his frayed shirt, and with the other hand snatches the food from him and then vanishes in the mist.First the lad curses and blasphemes, and then he gives way to a dreadful misery; he moans and cries and the tears form grotesque little rivulets down his grimy face. He wishes he was dead and prays for the pluck to cut his throat; he shrieks out for the woman's heart, her vitals; he curses her with every curse, and then he falls moaning again.Mr. B----- stands behind me as I drop a coin into the poor wretch's hand. He doesn't thank me but glares and blinks at me out of his wicked, tear-stained eyes, and in a low, hoarse voice says that he'll ""Go and get something to eat before she comes out again.""I inquire if she is the person who took the bread from him. He nods his head volubly.""And who is she?"" I ask.""My mother,"" he responds, laconically.I shrink back the remembrance of the curses ringing in my ears, and I shudder.As we go along we pass another lodging-house, and there we see a sight so indescribably painful that I find it difficult to realize that I am in a wealthy and humane city.It is an unfortunate: young, and as well as we can see under the dirt and paint, pretty. She has boots and stockings on and an old silk skirt, with a torn velvet bodice showing the flesh through the rents. She smells strongly of spirits, and we hear her imploring the deputy to trust her for a night's shelter. She offers him anything only to let her rest there that night. He refuses; she catches him by the hand, she almost kneels to him, but he is obdurate, shakes her from him and shuts the door on her.At first the poor creature seems paralyzed, then she shrieks and batters at the door with her hands, then she sobs with impotent misery, and calls on Christ to assist her.She tears at her dress, and falls to beating her bare breasts. She seems to take a fierce delight in torturing herself, for she strikes her head against the wall and drags out her lank hair by handfulls.I look stealthily at my watch, and I find that it is getting late, so we proceed to direct our footsteps toward Whitechapel road, which is the first stage of my return journey homewards. As we go along theLoafers Increase in Number.""These men,"" says Mr. B-----, ""are professional loafers: they sleep and drink all day, and at night they come out of the alleys and courts and lurk about the dark corners to see who they can knock down and rob. Why, if I had not been with you, you would have had every bit of your valuables stolen by this time. These fellows don't work because they won't; thieving pays them much better, and it is exciting. They know me, and they know that I know them; so that is the reason they have left us alone.""I hint a doubt as to the desirability of our detectives being so well known; but this Mr. B---- laughs at.""I'm in plain clothes,"" he says, ""and the folks about here recognize me; that is, because I want them to. We are not down here on business; we are merely sight-seeing, and I did not want our pleasure to be spoiled by getting into rows which I knew we could avoid by letting my calling be clearly noticeable. You mentioned a few minutes ago that since we left Berners street we have met no policemen. None we have met in uniform, but we have kept constantly running against our men so artfully dressed that you have seen no difference in them and the other individuals who were lounging about. The number of police that have been drafted down here is surprising.""We are now in Commercial street, and it seems to me a very paradise after the slums we have left. The mist has cleared away, and if it were not for the all-pervading and abominable smell of fried fish, the air would be delightfully fresh in comparison with Hanbury street.Whitechapel road itself is a great delight to me - it is wide and noisy and presents all the appearance of a fair. Either side of the road is a long row of stalls brilliantly lit up with portable gas, and everything under the sun can be bought there.There are butcher stalls presided over by loud-voiced men, who assure the bystanders that as it is late they are almost giving the meat away. A lean, pale woman carrying a baby, is haggling over the price of a piece of mutton. It is a fair-sized piece, and he at length agrees to take fourpence; she pays him in half-pennies and a little boy that is clinging to her skirt claps his thin hands rapturously.Men lounge about here, but they give me the idea of idling after work is done, for they have very little of the raffish look of their Berners and Hanbury street compeers.In short, the East End cannot be judged from the flourishing and busy Whitechapel road. It is the places that branch off from it that are so vile. It is the places where the moral sewage flows till they become hideous cesspools of vice and crime.Fine ladies, and white-handed gentlemen will do no good down here; indeed nothing will remedy the evils while lighting is deficient, sanitary conveniences absent, and these filthy dark alleys exist. I say my goodbye to Mr. B----- at the Aldgate station and thank him, as well as I may, for his courtesy and kindness, and for his presence, which has kept me from insult and robbery in what he describes as ""one of the (if not the) worst localities in London.""And as I return to my hotel I think with a thrill of disgust of the many horrible things I have seen and heard during my night's slumming in Whitechapel."

On Friday morning, about half-past ten o'clock, just as the city had decked itself in flags and garlands for the Lord Mayor's Show, a shocking discovery was made at Miller Court, Dorset-street, Spitalfields. A young man named Bowyer called at one of the rooms for the rent due to his master from an ""unfortunate"" named Maria Jane Kelley. Failing to make anyone hear, and finding the door locked, he went and informed his employer, who went back with him to the house, and putting his hand through a broken pane in the window pushed back the blind, when the horrid spectacle of a murdered woman met his gaze. The police were quickly summoned, and burst open the door.  A terrible scene presented itself. The body of the woman, perfectly nude, was stretched out on the little bed, the clothes on which were saturated with blood. The unfortunate woman had been cut and hacked by the assassin's knife in a manner which was revolting beyond all description. The fiendish assailant was not content with taking the life of his victim by severing the head from the body, but he had exercised an infernal ingenuity in despoiling the corpse of its human semblance. Both ears and the nose had been cut off, and the flesh of the cheeks and forehead peeled off; the breasts were cut away, evidently with a sharp knife, and placed on the table near the bed. The abdomen had been ripped open and disemboweled, portions of the entrails laying about the bed, the liver being placed between the legs. Both thighs had been denuded of flesh, laying bare the bones, and the excised portions laid on the table. One arm was almost severed from the trunk, and one hand thrust inside the empty cavity of the abdomen. Medical assistance was immediately summoned, and a description of the discovery telegraphed to all the metropolitan police-stations in the terse sentence: ""The woman is simply cut to pieces.""  Within a very short time half a dozen cabs arrived in Dorset-street from Whitehall, conveying detectives from the Criminal Investigation Department, among them being Inspectors Abberline and Reid. Never before had so many men been despatched to the scene of a murder from Whitehall.  The scene in the narrow courtway leading to the house was one of extraordinary excitement. The whole space was closely packed with detective officers, and quite a small army of plain-clothes constables was located in Dorset-street within an astonishingly short space of time. Dr. Phillips, the divisional surgeon of police, soon arrived, and was followed by Dr. Bond, of Westminster, divisional surgeon of the A Division, and Dr. J. R. Gabe, of Mecklenburgh-square, and two or three other surgeons.  They made a preliminary examination of the body, and sent for a photographer, who took several photographs of the remains. Meanwhile the excitement in the neighbourhood was spreading, until the dwellers in the immediate locality became worked up into a perfect frenzy. Women rushed about the streets telling their neighbours the news, and giving utterance in angry voices to expressions of rage and indignation. Notwithstanding the stolid reticence of all the police engaged at the scene, the main facts of the crime soon became common knowledge, and, spreading far and wide, drew a great concourse of the people to the thoroughfare from which the court runs. Great efforts were made at first to keep the side of Dorset-street clear in the vicinity of Miller-court, in the expectation that bloodhounds might have to be employed; but though it is understood that a telegram asking for them was sent to Sir Charles Warren, they were not sent.The Central News states, upon indisputable authority, that no portion of the murdered woman's body was taken away. A post-mortem examination was held by the medical authorities summoned by the police, and the surgeons did not quit their work until every organ had been accounted for, and placed as closely as possible in its natural position. In the case of his Mitre-square victim, a woman picked up in the street and murdered in the open air, the murderer's motive in endeavouring to render the features unrecognisable can readily be understood. But he could scarcely suppose that the identity of a woman renting the room as a regular lodger, and well known in the immediate locality of the crime, would fail to be capable of comparatively easy proof. It is therefore assumed by experts that the cutting off of the nose and ears and the slashing of the cheeks in this case were done in a transport of mad ferocity to which monomanics are often subject.Considerable doubt prevails as to the time at which the murder was committed. The discovery was made at half past ten o'clock, and it was at first stated that the woman had been seen as late as eight o'clock that morning, when she went to fetch some milk. That, however, appears to be a mistake, and the opinion of medical men who have examined the body is that in all probability the crime was committed between two and three o'clock in the morning. A woman named Kennedy, who was, on the night of the murder, staying with her parents at a house situated in the court immediately opposite the room in which the body of Mary Kelly was found, states that about three o'clock on Friday morning she entered Dorset-street on her way home. She noticed three persons at the corner of the street near the Britannia publichouse. There was a man - a young man, respectably dressed, and with a dark moustache - talking to a woman whom she did not know, and also a female poorly clad, and without any head gear. The man and woman appeared to be the worse for liquor, and she heard the man say, ""Are you coming?"" whereupon the woman, who appeared to be obstinate, turned in an opposite direction to which the man apparently wished her to go. Mrs. Kennedy went on her way, and nothing unusual occurred until about half an hour later. She did not retire to rest immediately she reached home, but sat up, and between half-past three and a quarter to four she heard a cry of ""Murder"" in a woman's voice proceed from the direction in which Mary Kelly's room was situated. As the cry was not repeated, she took no further notice of the circumstances until the morning, when she found the police in possession of the place, preventing all egress to the occupants of the small houses in this court. When questioned by the police, she made a statement to the above effect. She has since supplemented that statement by the following: -""On Wednesday evening, about eight o'clock, I and my sister were in the neighbourhood of Bethnal-green-road, when we were accosted by a very suspicious-looking man about 40 years of age. He was about five feet seven inches high, wore a short jacket, over which he had a long top-coat. He had a black moustache, and wore a billycock hat. He invited us to accompany him into a lonely spot, as he was known about there, and there was a policeman looking at him.""  She asserts that no policeman was in sight. He made several strange remarks, and appeared to be agitated. He was very white in the face, and made every endeavour to prevent them looking him straight in the face. He carried a black bag. He avoided walking with them, and led the way into a very dark thoroughfare, at the back of the workhouse, inviting them to follow, which they did. He then pushed open a small door in a pair of large gates, and requested one of them to follow him remarking, ""I only want one of you,"" whereupon the women became suspicious. He acted in a very strange and suspicious manner, and refused to leave his bag in possession of one of the women. They became alarmed at his actions, and escaped, at the same time raising an alarm of ""Jack the Ripper.""  A gentleman who was passing intercepted the man, while the women made their escape. Mrs. Kennedy asserts that the man whom she saw on Friday morning with the woman at the corner of Dorset-street resembled very closely the individual who caused such alarm on Wednesday night, and that she would recognise him again if confronted with him.A gentleman engaged in business in the vicinity of the murder stated on Sunday that he was walking through Mitre-square at about ten minutes past ten on Friday morning, when a tall, well-dressed man, carrying a parcel under his arm, and rushing along in a very excited manner, ran into him. The man's face was covered with blood splashes, and his collar and shirt were also blood-stained. The gentleman did not at the time know anything of the murder.The young man, with whom the deceased had recently been living, gave himself up to the police on Friday, and was able satisfactorily to account for his movements on Thursday night. A pilot-coat found in the deceased's room has also been accounted for.THE  INQUEST  -  A  SHOCKING  REVELATION.The inquest on the body was held at the Shoreditch Town Hall, on Monday, before Dr. Macdonald, M.P. Describing the proceedings, the Daily News says:  The first witness was Joseph Barnet [Barnett]. He had lived with the deceased for a year and eight months, and appeared to be in pretty full possession of all the main facts in the unhappy woman's history. A very deplorable history it proved to be. She had been married at 16 to a Welsh collier, who was killed in an explosion. She had then gone to Cardiff with a cousin, who, the witness said, had been the cause of her downfall, and from there had come to London, to a Madam somebody in the West-end. A gentleman had then taken her to France, and from France, after a short time, she came over to Ratcliff Highway. Subsequently she had lived with two men in succession, to the latter of whom she had been greatly attached. He (the witness) had met her casually in Whitechapel, they had had a drink together, and arranged the compact which seems to have held good till the 30th of last month, when, out of compassion, she had taken into her room an immoral woman, and over this they quarrelled and parted. The main interest of this man's story runs in the gruesome light it threw on a profligate career of eight short years. It did nothing [to] elucidate the mystery of her death, nor indeed did any of the evidence given. Through the phantasmagoria of the Coroner's Court there did indeed flit figures, probably more or less apocryphal, of men who might have done the deed. One doleful-looking little body, with a negress-type of features, told how she and and another had been frightened by a mysterious stranger who had tried to lure them by the offer of money into a retired spot;  but they both took to their heels and ran away. Not much importance was to be attached to this testimony, probably, nor to that of one or two others who had seen men under suspicious circumstances. Perhaps the most sensational bit of evidence tendered was that of a garrulous young woman who, with some dramatic force, imitated by voice and action a sort of nightmare cry of ""Oh! murder!"" which she declared she had heard just after she had been woke up by her kitten rubbing its nose against her face about half-past three or four o'clock on the morning of the murder. It was a faintish cry, she said, as though somebody had woke up with the nightmare, and though the evidence must be taken with the reserve that should attach to all such testimony, the time at which she believes she heard the cry would tally very well with all the circumstances of the case, and it is not impossible that that really was the death gasp of the poor woman in the clutches of her murderer. Some confirmation is added to this supposition by the evidence of another witness, Sarah Lewis, who lived a short distance off, but had had some falling out at home, and went to stay the night with a friend at Miller's-court, where she sat and dozed in a chair. She woke up about 3:30 by Spitalfields Church clock, and a little before four o'clock - agreeing with this with the other witness - she also heard one cry of ""Murder!"". She, however, says it was a loud shout, whereas another witness, who was awake the whole of the night, and who believes she must have heard any such cry if it had been made, swore that she heard not a sound. As to the evidence of the woman Caroline Maxwell, who swore that she saw the deceased at eight or nine o'clock on Friday morning, that is regarded by the police as merely an error of date. No doubt she did see the woman, and spoke to her as she stated, but on Thursday morning instead of Friday. Nothing was said as to the probable time of the murder, but we have reason to believe that the conclusion arrived at by several medical men who were on the spot shortly after the discovery of the body was that the deed had been done certainly not later than six or seven on Friday morning, and it might have been a good deal earlier. Inspector Abberline, of the Scotland-yard detectives, in reply to questions as to the probable reason of certain articles of clothing having been burnt in Kelly's grate, expressed his belief that they had been burnt to light the murderer in his ghastly work. Dr. Phillips's evidence was conclusive as to the cause of death. It had resulted from the severance of the right carotid artery; and, after the throat had been cut, the body, said the doctor, must have been removed from one side of the bed to the other. As to the mutilation of the body, no evidence was given beyond that of the death wound; and, as Dr. Phillips's evidence was absolutely conclusive as to the cause of death, and the police had no testimony to produce indicating the criminal, Dr. Macdonald put it to the jury whether it was necessary to go any further. He did not wish unduly to influence them, but all they had to do was to determine the cause of the woman's death, and if they thought that had been sufficiently proved, there would be no occasion for an adjournment. After a brief deliberation the jury came unanimously to the conclusion that they had carried the inquiry far enough, and that the matter might now be left in the hands of the police. They accordingly returned a verdict of ""Wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.""DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  PROBABLE  MURDERER.On Monday evening the police received information of a most important nature, which not only establishes a clue to the perpetrator of the Dorset-street murder, but places the authorities in possession of an accurate and full description of a person who was seen in company with the murdered woman during the night on which she met her death. A man, apparently of the labouring class, but of a military appearance, who knew the deceased, on Monday night lodged with the police a long and detailed statement of an incident which attracted his attention on the day in question. The following is a summary of the statement, and it may be said that notwithstanding examination and re-examination by the police, the man's story cannot be shaken, and so circumstantial and straightforward were his assertions that the police believe they have at length been placed in possession of facts which will open up a new line of investigation, and probably enable them to track the criminal. This man states that on the morning of the 9th instant he saw the deceased woman, Mary Janet Kelley, in Commercial-street, Spitalfields (the vicinity where the murder was committed), in company with a man of respectable appearance. The man was about 5 feet 6 inches in height, and 34 or 35 years of age, with dark complexion and dark moustache curled up at the ends. He was wearing a long dark coat trimmed with astrachan, a white collar with black necktie, in which was affixed a horseshoe pin. He wore a pair of dark gaiters with light buttons, over button boots, and displayed from his waistcoat a massive gold chain. The highly respectable appearance of this individual was in such great contrast to that of the woman that few people could have failed to remark them at that hour of the morning. This description, which substantiates that given by others of the person seen in company with the deceased on the morning she was killed, is much fuller in detail than that hitherto in the possession of the police, and the importance they attach to this man's story may be imagined when it is mentioned that it was forwarded to the headquarters of the H Division as soon as completed by a special detective. Detective Abberline, Nairn, and Moore were present when this message arrived, and an investigation was immediately set on foot.WHY  THE  BLOODHOUNDS  WERE  NOT  USED.An inquiry has been made to elicit the facts with reference to the non-employment of bloodhounds immediately the tragedy of Dorset-street was discovered. It appears that, at Sir Charles Warren's request, Mr. Brough, the well-known bloodhound breeder, of Scarborough, was communicated with shortly after the Mitre-square and Berner-street outrages, and asked to bring a couple of trained hounds up to London for the purpose of testing their capabilities in the way of following the scent of the man. The hounds were named Burgho and Barnaby, and in one of the trials Sir Charles Warren himself acted as the quarry, and expressed satisfaction, at the result. Arrangements were made for the immediate conveyance of the animals to the spot in the event of another murder occurring, and in order to facilitate matters Mr. Brough, who was compelled to return to Scarborough, left the hounds in the care of a friend of his, Mr. Taunton, of Doughty-street, who was entrusted with their custody pending the conclusion of the negotiations which had been opened for the ultimate purchase of the dogs. Sir Charles Warren, however, would not give any definite assurance on this point, and Mr. Brough insisted on resuming possession of the animals. One of them, Burgho, was sent to a show at Brighton, the other remaining in Mr. Taunton's custody. About a fortnight ago this gentleman received a telegram from Leman-street Police-station, asking him to bring the dog to assist in discovering the perpetrators of a burglary in Commercial-street. The police then admitted that subsequently to the burglary they had been all over the premises, and Mr. Taunton pointed out to them that it was absurd to expect that the bloodhounds could accomplish anything under such conditions. The owner of the dogs, on learning these facts, telegraphed peremptorily insisting that Barnaby should be returned to him at once, having in view the danger of the hound being poisoned if it was known that the police were employing it to track burglars - and Mr. Brough had no guarantee of compensation in case of the animal suffering maltreatment. From these circumstances it will be seen that there has been no trained bloodhound in the metropolis at any time during the past fortnight. The Whitechapel officials themselves were not aware of this fact, for their first thought on receiving the intelligence of the murder was to leave the room absolutely undisturbed until the hounds should be brought on the scene, and it was only when they learnt that there were no bloodhounds to be had that an entrance was effected into the chamber.A  LETTER  FROM  JACK  THE  RIPPER.Mrs. McCarthy, the wife of the landlord of the house where the murder occurred, has received a postcard bearing the Folkestone postmark, and signed ""Jack Sheridan, the Ripper.""  In bad spelling and equally bad caligraphy, the writer said, ""Don't be alarmed. I am going to do another; but this time it will be a mother and daughter.""  The postcard, unlike any of the previous communications of a similar character, was written in black ink, and the writing did not bear any resemblance to that of previous communications. It was at once handed over to the detectives.RESIGNATION  OF  SIR  CHARLES  WARREN.Replying to a question addressed to him by Mr. Conybeare, in the House of Commons on Monday, the Home Secretary announced that Sir Charles Warren, on the 8th inst., tendered his resignation as Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, and the resignation had been accepted.The Press Association learns ""on the highest authority"" that the relations between Sir Charles Warren and the Home Office have for some time been strained. The action of the department in reference to the resignation of Mr. Monro caused the first serious difference of opinion. Sir Charles took exception to certain of the methods of the Assistant Commissioner, and he intimated to Mr. Matthews that either he or Mr. Monro must resign. A few days afterwards Mr. Monro's resignation was announced. Sir Charles complains that Mr. Monro's resignation was accepted without consultation with him, and that prior to the Home Secretary's statement in the House of Commons on Monday evening he (Sir Charles Warren) was not even aware of the reason assigned by his subordinate for severing his connection with Scotland-yard. Since Mr. Monro's transference to the Home Office matters have become worse. Sir Charles complains that, whereas he has been saddled with all the responsibility, he has had no freedom of action, and in consequence his position has become daily more unbearable. Although Mr. Monro has been no longer in evidence at Whitehall-place, he has to all intents and purposes retained control of the Criminal Investigation Department. Indeed, Mr. Matthews on Monday evening admitted that he was deriving the benefit of the advice of Mr. Monro in matters relating to crime, and was in communication with him at the present time on the subject of the organization of the detective staff. This division of authority Sir Charles Warren has strenuously fought against. He maintains that if the Commissioner is to be responsible for the discipline of the force instructions should be given to no department without his concurrence. Latterly, in spite of the remonstrances of Sir Charles Warren, the control of the Criminal Investigation Department has been withdrawn more and more from Whitehall Place. Every morning for the last few weeks there has been a protracted conference at the Home Office between Mr. Monro, Mr. Anderson, and the principal detective inspectors, and the information furnished to the Commissioner in regard to those conferences has been, he states, of the scantiest character. These facts will explain how, apart from any other consideration, it was impossible for Sir Charles Warren, holding the views he did in regard to the functions of the Commissioner, to continue in command. The reproof of the Home Secretary last week in reference to the article in Murray's Magazine completed the rupture. Sir Charles thereupon took counsel with his friends, and immediately tendered his resignation to the Home Secretary. On Monday morning his books and papers were removed from the Commissioner's office, and this was the first intimation in Whitehall-place that he had relinquished the position."

The woman who was seen in the company of two soldiers, with whom was the deceased, has not been able to identify either of the men at the Tower as being her companion on the evening of the murder. Inspector Reid and the other officers engaged in the case have in no way relaxed their efforts to trace the criminal, and yesterday, the inspector, accompanied by ""Pearly Poll"", who was in the company of the murdered woman, proceeded to the Tower, where she was confronted with every non-commissioned officer and private who had leave of absence at the time of the outrage. They were paraded at the back of the Tower, unseen by the public, and ""Pearly Poll"" was asked, ""Can you see either of the men you saw with the woman now dead?"" ""Pearly Poll,"" in no way embarrassed, placed her arms akimbo, glanced at the men with the air of an inspecting officer, and shook her head. This indication of a negative was not sufficient. ""Can you identify anyone?"" she was asked. ""Pearly Poll"" exclaimed, with a good deal of feminine emphasis ""He ain't here"". The woman was very decided on this point, and the men were then dismissed, while the two upon whom a faint shadow of suspicion had rested were considerably relieved at their innocence being declared. As soon as the murder was known, the suspected Corporal was interviewed by the police and questioned. He had his bayonet with him when on leave at the time of the outrage; but this he at once produced, and no trace of blood was discovered upon it. His clothing, too, was also examined, and upon it there was no incriminating bloodstain. After the parade, Adjutant Cotton, the officer in command, stated that all the men were now entirely exonerated. Indeed, the men were themselves most anxious to afford every facility to the police, and gave all the information in their power to assist the officers of justice in their investigation."

Good old Leather Apron.""Another letter, bearing a Kilburn postmark, was written to Mr. Lusk, of the Whitechapel vigilance committee, as follows:""I write you a letter in black ink, as I have no more of the right stuff. I think you are all asleep in Scotland yard with your bloodhounds, as I will show you tomorrow night (Saturday). I am going to do a double event, but not in Whitechapel. Got rather too warm there; had to shift. No more till you hear from me again.Jack the Ripper."""

He is the fellow,  who in 1860, burst upon the people of Brooklyn as a sort of modern Count of Monte Christo, and cut a  wide swath in the affections of certain susceptible women. After a few months he dropped out of sight  as suddenly as he had appeared, and was next heard of being implicated in the famous yellow fever  importations and ""Black bag"" plots that the rebel sympathisers tried to develop in New York during the  civil war. Afterwards he visited the city and Brooklyn at about semi-yearly intervals and became a  member of several questionable clubs. Ten years ago he finally disappeared.Tumblety came to New York in 1864 from Nova Scotia, where he was known as doctor Sullivan. It is  claimed Sullivan fled to the States to escape arrest for malpractice, having nearly killed a patient he  had been called upon to attend by administering wrong medicines. The authorities were informed of the  strange goings on in the doctor's office, but were unable to get sufficient evidence against Sullivan  or Tumblety to warrant them taking him into custody. Sixteen or seventeen years since Tumblety had some  difficulty with Editor Ralston of Frank Leslie's Weekly. The outcome was a full exposure of his doings  in Nova Scotia, and also in this city. He has been known to Inspector Byrne for over twenty years and  has always been regarded as a suspicious and mysterious individual."

After the strange experience of yesterday it will be hard to deny that there are any newspaper made murders. For an hour or two London was encouraged to believe that the Whitechapel miscreant had added one more to his long list of victims. For an hour or two more it was told  that he had failed in the fatal stroke by a hair's breadth but that a woman lay at the point of death. The woman is even of a lower type than the other women who were the victims of the Whitechapel murderer. Her associates say she is quarrelsome and that the man whom she accused of trying to cut her throat had been visiting her nearly a year. People at the house heard them quarrelling at nine o'clock today and when the man ran down the stairs the woman followed him to the top of the landing and screamed: ""He tried to cut my throat, follow him."" Three men gave chase, but the fellow got away easily enough. This is the only significant thing about the whole affair, that a man could escape so easily in the broad daylight on streets patrolled by police and filled with people. The police know who the man is and where he lives, and have been watching the house all day. When he gets over his fright and returns home they expect to get him. There is not the slightest reason to suppose that he is the Whitechapel fiend. The police believe the woman inflicted the wound upon herself. The injury is slight. A really interesting incident of the day is another letter from Jack the Ripper, dated at Portsmouth. Here it is:Dear Boss: It is no good for you to look for me in London because I am not there. Don't trouble yourself about me til I return, which will not be long. Oh, that was such a jolly job, that last one. I had plenty of time to do it properly. Ha! Ha! the next one I mean to do with a vengeance. Cut off their heads and arms. You think it is a man with a black moustache. Ha! ha! ha! When I have done another you can catch me. So goodbye, dear Boss, til I return.Yours Jack the Ripper.The letter is in the same writing as the one received just before the woman was murdered."

Two employees of the New York, New Haven & Hartfort Railway Company, which uses pier 46 as a freight depot, were the first to see the body of a woman floating face downward in the clear water between the lighters and the New Haven dock.The body was that of a young and stoutly built woman apparently under thirty years of age. In life she might have been comely, but this is mere surmise, for some fiendish hand had cut and gashed the features in such a merciless fashion as to render their symmetry a mockery.There was every indication that this woman had only yielded life after a fearful struggle, and how and where she encountered her assassin are questions to which no answer is as yet forthcoming. The face, throat and scalp were cut in five places and coagulated blood filled the wounds.The largest wound was in the forehead, running from the hair in the right temple across to the outer side of the left eyebrow. There was terrible gash in the throat to the right of and a little blow the chin, looking as if the murderer had turned his knife around before withdrawing it. There were also two cuts in the throat under the left ear. The scalp had been laid open from the top of the right ear to the median line of the skull. There was a terrible bruise on the left breast. The fleshy lobe of the left ear, which had borne a cheap gold plated earring, was torn away.In the lower part of the abdomen there was a wound which suggested the handiwork of Jack the Ripper.The coarse black hair was knotted and twisted into ropes as if the murderer had held his victim by it while he cut and slashed with his knife.The body was only partially robed.It lay in the street covered by a few empty sacks for four hours before the city hearse arrived to remove it. During all this time the brisk west wind played havoc with the rude shroud, blowing its edges this way and that, affording horrible entertainment to the curious crowd.Morgue keeper White made a careful superficial examination of the remains. He found three teeth missing in the left upper jaw, but the rest were in a good state of preservation. He declared that the cuts were doubtless made by a knife - probably a sailor's jack knife - wielded by a man maddened by liquor. The coroner's physician did not, of course, turn up to perform the official autopsy.The girl could not have been much more than 25 years of age. Appearances go to show that she was probably an habitué of the tough Water street dives much affected by sailors off for a spree. She might have been tolerably good looking.The theory of the police regarding the murder is that the woman was lured aboard a craft along the river front or went thither willingly with some of the tough characters which infest the locality. It is supposed that the ""growler"" (?) was worked freely until all hands became intoxicated and that then in the drunken row which ensued the woman received the injuries which caused her death."

She attempted to get up, and ran a hundred yards, her cries for help being heard by several persons in the adjacent houses. No attention was paid to her cries, however, and when found at daybreak she was lying dead in another street, several hundred yards from the scene of the attack. Her head was nearly severed from her body, which was literally cut to pieces, one gash reaching from pelvis to the breast bone. This is the third murder of the kind which has been done lately. In the last one, two weeks ago, the victim was stabbed thirty nine times. In the case before, some months ago, the victim was stabbed with a stick, which was forced through the body. All three victims have been women of the lowest class. All three murders have taken place in the same district, at about the same hour, and have been characterized by the same inhuman and ghoulish brutality.

LONDON. Sept. 30.--This morning the whole city was again startled by the news that two more murders had been added to the list of mysterious crimes that have been committed in Whitechapel. At an early hour it was known that another woman had been murdered and a report was also current that there was still another victim. This report proved true. The two victims as in the former cases were dissolute women of the poorest class. The first murder occurred in a narrow court off Berners street beneath the window of a foreigners' socialistic club, the woman's throat had been cut from ear to ear but the villain had evidently been frightened away before he had time to mutilate the body.

Oct. 2--The trunk of a woman was found in a recess of the new police offices on the Thames embankment this afternoon. The head, arms and legs were missing. The remains, which were in an advanced state of decomposition, were wrapped in rough cloth and tightly bound with cord. It is believed that the arms recently found at Pimlico and Lambeth were cut from this body. The Whitechapel Murders LONDON, Oct 2.--The excitement occasioned by the latest Whitechapel murders increased rather than abated yesterday and to-day. The police have made no progress in their efforts to establish a clue to the murderer and have further lost public confidence in their effeciency by the fact that the persons arrested on suspicion of connection with the tragedies were released to-day for want of even a scintilla of evidence upon which to justify their retention in custody. They profess to be hopeful of success, however, and many people are inclined to hope with them in the absence of any suspicion in their own mind, even remotely defined, as to the criminal's motive, calling or identity. The private rewards offered for his arest added to that of the Lord Mayor bring the total sum up to £1200, and it is likely that it was soon reach £200. Dr. Forbes Winslow and Sir Riedon Bennett and other medical experts express themselves as more than ever convinced that the perpetrator of the crimes is a homicidal lunatic. The fact that the latest murders were committed within the jurisdiction of the city police has created a sharp rivalry between that body and Gen. Warren's metropolitan detectives. Many wagers have been laid upon the question of the murderer's capture, with the odds largely in favor of the city police force solving the mystery and landing the fiend in jail. It is now proposed to send a circular to every householder in the East End requesting the details of the movements, habits, etc. of their respective lodgers. The theory has largely obtained support to-day that the murderer has two domiciles, one probably as a shop or surgery, to which he retires for the purpose of removing the traces of his crime, and the other a dwelling house where he is known as a lodger, whose habits and manners make him a desirable tenant in the estimation of his landlady. The police are being urged to station bloodhounds in the Whitechapel district, in the hope that they may be able by their keenness of scent to run the fiend down when he seeks a fresh victim. An inquest was held to-day on the body of the woman found murdered in a narrow court off Berners street Monday morning. A sister of the victim was called and deposed that she awoke at 12 o'clock Monday morning and heard kisses and a sound which she thought was made by a person falling to the ground. She was convinced that her sister was dead, and after reading the accounts of the murder in the newspapers, went to the morgue and recognized the body of the murdered woman as that of her sister. The house in which the witness resides is several miles from Berners street. The murder is believed to have been committed about 12.50 [30?] o'clock Sunday morning. "

Important political utterances which ordinarily would provoke general discussion are unread, and continental affairs of vital interest to England are thrust aside as of no consequence whatever. The police have adopted the theory that the letter and the postal card signed ""Jack the Ripper"" sent to The Central News, a week ago Thursday, emanated from the actual murderer. Facsimiles of the letter and card are posted in every police station and upon every dead wall, accompanied by a paragraph begging any person recognizing the writing to communicate with Gen. Sir Charles Warren, chief commissioner of the Metropolitan police. The Central News received another communication from ""Jack the Ripper,"" yesterday afternoon, announcing his intention to commit more murders to-night, and upon the strength of this the police have ordered every man on duty and are assisted by hundreds of amateur detectives. The reign of terror which has prevailed in the Whitechapel district during the past week still continues and the arrival of daylight to-morrow will be hailed with joy by thousands of the denizens of that locality. The sentimental objection to the use of bloodhounds in pursuing criminals has been broken down entirely by the immunity of the murderer. Had Sir Charles Warren six months since ordered bloodhounds he would have lost his place, it being thought that he had already lost his head. But now the public demand enables the police to employ dogs. Nothing more is known of the murderer. His identity is as much hidden as though he possessed the invisible cap of Perseus. Nothing being known enables much to be guessed. Yesterday the theory was that he is a Malay. The coroner's theory, that the murders are due to the offer of an American of rewards for certain organs, has been given up, and the mystery is left more mysterious than ever. "

At the inquest on the trunk of a woman found in a cellar in Whitehall on Tuesday last, surgeons who examined the remains testified that they were those of an unusually fine woman who had probably occupied a high social position. Saturday's Daily Telegraph published two sketch portraits form descriptions of the man last seen in the company of the woman named Stride, one of the victims of the Whitechapel murder fiend. The result has seen the unceremonious arrest of every man bearing any resemblance to the pictures, and a great deal of discomfort has been caused by this new phase of police activity. Many of the arrests are made by self-constituted detectives ofr abitious vigilance committees. The victims are gereally discharged from custody as soon as brought before a magistrate, but some are unlucky enough not to be able to satisfy the officials of the circuit and are subjected to more less annoying detention. One of the men arrested carried a bag, in which was found a razor. This suspect is still held, and will have to give a very good account of himself and his razor. Another perplexity attending the Whitechapel muddle is due to the fact that the regular police do not know by sight the amateur detectives, and the latter are occasionally ""help up"" and put to the embaressment of explaining their presence and mysterious movements in the much watched district.

Dr. Openshaw examined the enclosure yesterday, and said that it certainly came from a full grown woman, and had been divided longtitudinally.

Most of them have  probably seen an unusually elongated young man, with a mustache  that has excited the admiration of young ladies, the envy of young  men, and the astonishment of everybody else.  Whether this  remarkable hirsute appendage is a product of ""simple herbs,"" or  somebody's onguent, is a secret only known to the Indian Doctor  himself.  To add further to these characteristics which distinguish  him from ordinary human beings the Doctor wears a butternut-colored  suit, the unusual width of his pantaloons being counter balanced by  the brevity of his coat tails.  A pork-pie cap and a stout yellow  cane complete the outfit of this singular personage.  He is  generally accompanied by a large yellow dog, long and lean, which  looks so much like his master that one is supposed to know nearly  as much as the other.  The Doctor has been seen on horseback, but  generally travels on foot, accompanied by his faithful poodle.  The  Doctor is a mystery; his presence being too awe inspiring to permit  anybody to inquire into his history.  He is supposed, however, to  be as genuine an Indian as most of the Indians exhibited in this  latitude.  It is given out that he was a great medicine man of the  Saltz-an-Sennah tribe, who, instead of placing himself in the  Museum of the L. I. Historical Society, as a curiosity, concluded  to make a living and bless his fellowmen by practising the healing  art.We append this personal sketch to introduce the Doctor, because he  was introduced to the Police Court this morning by our old friend,  officer Riggs of the 41st, on the plain charge of kicking a white  man downstairs.  The aggrieved party was a patient of the Doctor's,  named Fenton Scully, who came all the way from 21 Bethune street,  New York, attracted by the fame of the medicine man.  Mr. Scully,  who was not a healthy subject, had been suffering from asthma.  The  Doctor contracted to cure him by the job for $15.  The Doctor gave  him plenty of medicine for his money, and he was directed to take  it in liberal doses, a wine glass full, say every five minutes,  until he was better or worse.  Scully's asthma obstinately resisted  the deluge and got worse, and he concluded, while he had breath  enough left in his body to go and see the Doctor again.  He called  on him yesterday; and told him the circumstances.  The Indian  Hippocrates told him that his case was hopeless, and recommended  resignation.  Mr. Scully then suggested that as the Doctor had not  completed his contract he ought to refund some of the money.  This  was entirely too much for the Doctor's professional equanimity.  It  was bad enough to have a patient who obstinately refused to be  cured; but to ask for his money back was adding insult to injury.   He ordered Scully to leave the premises.  Scully, like his asthma,  was obstinate, and wouldn't go.  The Doctor then tried a course of  physical treatment on the refractory patient with the most signal  success.  The prescription read: Patient taken vigorously by the  collar; well shaken after taken; sole leather promptly applied to  the base of the dorsal vertabrae; result, prompt evacuation--of the  premises by the patient.Mr. Scully did not consider this satisfactory treatment, for a man  in delicate health, so he consulted Officer Riggs, who was of the  same opinion, and took Scully before Justice Perry, who granted a  warrant, which led to the production this morning of the Indian  Doctor.  Instead of his faithful dog, the Doctor was accompanied by  Mr. Parmenter, once a legal luminary in the Police Court, at whose  suggestion the examination of the case was postponed until Monday  next.  On being asked his name, that the case might be properly  recorded, the Indian Doctor gave his name as Francis Tumblety."

Fenton Scully, the asthmatic  complainant, being placed in the stand, swore that the Doctor  promised to cure him complete for $20; that he paid $14 on account  and received a liberal supply of medicine.  He took the medicine  home and applied it internally, but got worse instead of better; he  then came to Brooklyn to see the Doctor again, and told him that  the medicine made him worse; that the Doctor refused to have  anything at all to say to him, and finally kicked him several times  in the ribs and knocked him down stairs.  Per contra the Doctor  produced two witnesses, who magnanimously swore that the Doctor  never touched Scully, that the latter was disorderly in his  behavior, drove several patients out of the office, and that the  Doctor, after politely requesting him to leave, took him by the arm  and led him out.

What made his  appearance so remarkable was the style of his habiliments, which  were decidedly outre.  On his first appearance, he generally  wore nankeen pants, and in the course of a few days he came to be  styled the ""nankeen swell,"" &c.  He was generally accompanied in  his perambulations by a huge greyhound, which was in the habit of  taking the most of the walk by running against ladies and  gambolling around the ""nankeen"" individual, in a style which often  resulted disastrously to the dresses of ladied whom the man and dog  happened to meet.  All this display, however, was made with a  motive, and, in a few days, by copious posters, handbills, &c., the  man in the ""nankeen pants"" was merged in THE GREAT INDIAN HERB DOCTOR,whose astounding cures of all the diseases to which flesh is heir,  had excited the wonder and envy of the disciples of Esculapius all  the world over.  Subsequent investigation into the antecedents of  the imposing personage who had honored the City of Churches by  coming here to use his mighty talent in the healing art, on the  bodily ailment of our suffering citizens, showed that this great "" medicine man"", who called himself Blackburn, was in reality namedDR. TUMBLETY,and that the change in his name was a matter not of choice, but of  necessity, growing out of some matters which transpired before his  arrival here.  At first the doctor was successful, as all men will  be who appreciate the value of judicious advertising, but by and by  his patients began to drop off and found it prudent to leave the  city.  ""His occupation,"" like Othello's, ""was gone.""  He made a hit  in another direction, however, rumor having it that, like the  venerable Mr. Turveydrop, he had succeeded in making a good living  out of his ""deportment,"" having gained the heart and hand of the  heiress of one of the richest families on the Heights, who fell in  love with him while on a professional visit.The establishment of the doctor, which was situatedIN FULTON STREETnear to Nassau, consisted of a suite of three rooms which he  occupied as an office and sleeping apartments.  Besides the doctor  these rooms generally had TWO OTHER OCCUPANTS,and it is of one of these that this article is written.  These two  men were the hangers on or dependents of the doctor, occupying  different positions, however, in his esteem.  The taller of them  was treated by the doctor as a sort of confidential valet, while  the other one, who was shorter and of a stouter build, performed  the duties of hostler to the two stylish looking piebald horses, on  which the doctor and his confidential valet were wont to excite the  admiration of foolish females.  The most remarkable thing about the  doctor's establishment was the manner in which his wardrobe was  distributed.  Almost every day the doctor had on some new garment,  and on the same day, the one which he had worn on the previous one  would be seen on the back of his valet, and the next day from the  valet to the hostler, and from thence for aught we know to the  second hand clothes' dealers.  Everybody who has been in the habit  of travelling in Fulton street during the past year, will have a  distinct recollection of the doctor and his valet, and it was at  the time a general subject of remark, that the valet seemed to ape  almost unconsciously all the airs of his master, and appeared to  pay him the same deference which those who generally accompanied  them did.  This fact will be recalled with fearful distinctness now  by many who formerly noticed it, for this accomplice of Booth and  Harold, who was arrested as above stated, and who knows the parties  well, stated to the police that this soi distant valet was  none other than THE NOTORIOUS HAROLDwho is now awaiting the just punishment of his horrible crime, and  it would seem that he had attached himself to the Indian Herb  Doctor in the same manner in which he subsequently attached himself  to Booth from a womanish sort of admiration for his supposed  cleverness.THE HISTORY OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCEwas stated by the boy to be as follows: Shortly before the arrival  of the doctor here, he made the acquaintance of J. Wilkes Booth in  Washington, and through him became acquainted with Harold.  Harold,  who had some knowledge of the drug business, was then out of  employment and the doctor, who was just then in need of a person of  that sort to accompany him, offered Harold a chance to go with him  and Harold accepted the offer.  When the doctor was compelled by  the force of circumstances to abandon his lucrative position here,  Harold went back to Washington, and this was the last that was  heard of him until the commission of the fearful tragedy which has  eternally linked his name to infamy."

H. Blackburn, was yesterday arrested by a United States  detective, on a charge of complicity with the assassination of  President Lincoln.  Dr. Tumblety will be summoned to Washington to  undergo examination.  Harold and the Herb Doctor are said to have  been partners in Brooklyn, and this bare fact may have given rise  to the report which is now circulated through the telegraph.  The  Doctor maintains that the charge is utterly without foundation, and  it is rumored that he will demand of the Provost Marshal full  restitution or exoneration.Tumblety is a character of national or international reputation.   His eccentricities and oddities are the subject of general comment  here, and have awakened curiosity in all the principal cities of  the country.  He originally started in his career, we believe, in  Rochester, N.Y., where, when quite a boy, he was employed at first  as servant or errand boy in the office of Dr. Lispenard, on  Exchange place, a celebrated special practioner.  He afterwards  studied medicine with Lispenard, and graduated in a short time, and  it is stated left Rochester unceremoniously.  In 1857 he appeared  in Toronto, Canada, and opened an office on King street, where  crowds of people daily flocked to his rooms to test his wonderful  vegetable cures.In front of his office was displayed as a sign, a large pair of  buck horns, which he claimed were presented to him by an Indian  chief named ""Sundown,"" a savage of the plains, with whom he was  intimately acquainted.  In Toronto he was periodically assailed and  denounced by the resident physicians for practicing without license  and invading upon their rights.  Be that the case or not, he  certainly reaped large grains from his eccentric pretensions, and  produced numerous witnesses to attest the skill with which he cured  human ailments.  He next visited Montreal, Canada East, and went  through the same programme, being assailed by the regular  profession.  The public prints at the time in that city berated the  Doctor extensively, and it is stated that he was compelled to leave  the city on account of cases instituted against him in the courts.   Whether such prosecutions were but part of the persecution he was  subjected to or not, we leave the public to judge.In '62 the Doctor turned up in Washington City and located his  office on Pennsylvania avenue.  He was the general feature of  curiosity in the city, drawing attent[i]on from the distinguished  men of the nation and exciting general remark on account of his  peculiarities of dress.  It is said that he would appear in two or  three different outfits upon the street in as many hours, being  always known by his tall form and dignified step, his curly hair  and mammoth moustache.Often would he be seen down the prominent thoroughfare, mounted  upon a spotted circus horse, richly accoutred, and displaying fine  horsemanship, or at other times would appear upon the promenade  followed by a fine looking mulatto and a mouse-colored hound, which  he still retain[s].  Since that time he has visited New Orleans and  nearly all the principal cities of the United States, meeting  everywhere with ast[o]unding success--the lion among the bloods,  and the gayest of the gay.  It is said that he never returns to a  place after once leaving it, but bears with him always, great  pecuniary consolation.It is stated that several years ago, the Doctor visited Buffalo, N .Y., and announced to the public, through the columns of the press,  that he would, the day following, meet any merchant of that city on  the steps of the Merchants' Exchange, and there distribute fifty  sacks of flour to the poor.  The proprietors of one of the papers,  desiring to know more about the Doctor, telegraphed to Toronto,  inquiring who he was, when the answer came back from the Bank of  Toronto, ""His check ir good for $60,000 in this bank."" At the  appointed time the Doctor distributed to the poor his fifty bags of  flour, and the next day published advertisements and issued hand  bills, announcing to the too credulous public that he was cure ""all  the ills that flesh is heir to.""  Of course, his charity was more  than repaid.In this city his history is one of unprecedented success and great  notoriety.  His eccentricities of dress and business ingenuity have  been subjects of comment for some time.  His offices have been  crowded with applicants for medical relief, and the daily papers  have been filled with notices of his ""wonderful cures.""  It is said  that when he first opened his office on Olive street, he hired a  newsboy to perambulate the streets, with his face painted red like  an Indian boy, and his head adorned with long feathers.  This boy  would stand at the foot of the stairs, and deal out to passers  programmes and ""dodgers.""  Most of our readers will doubtless  remember the arrest of the doctor some time ago by the Provost  Guard for appearing in the street in military clothing."

Kirkwood House,					Washington, June 17To the Editor of the Brooklyn Eagle:Allow me to ask as a great personal favor, that you give the  enclosed card publicity, in order that those of your city who know  me may see that I am again at liberty, having been entirely  exonerated from the foul charges brought against me in some of the  Northern journals.  Respectfully, T. Tumblety, M.D.To the Editor of the Star:After three weeks' imprisonment in the Old Capitol Prison, in this  city, I have been unconditionally and honorably released from  confinement by direction of the Secretary of War, there being no  evidence whatever to connect me with the yellow fever, or  assassination plot, with which some of the Northern journals have  charged me of having some knowledge.  My arrest appears to have  grown out of a statement made in a low, licentious sheet published  in New York, to the effect that Dr. Blackburn, who has figured so  unenviably in the hellish yellow fever plot, was no other person  than myself.  In reply to this statement I would most respectfully  say to an ever-generous public that I do not know this fiend in  human form named Dr. Blackburn, nor have I ever seen him in my  life.  For the truth of this assertion I can bring hundreds of  distinguished persons throughout the United States to vouch for my  veracity, and, if necessary can produce certificates from an  innumerable number of gentlemen in high official positions.While in imprisonment I noticed in some of the New York and other  northern papers, a paragraph setting forth that the villain Harold,  who now stands charged with being one of the conspirators in the  attrocious assassination plot, was at one time in my employ.  This,  too, is false in every particular, and I am at loss to see how it  originated, or to trace it to its origin.  For the past five years  I have had but one man in my employment, and he is yet with  me, his character being beyond reproach.  I never saw Harold to my  knowledge, and I have no desire to see him.Another paper has gone so far as to inform the public that I was an  intimate acquaintance of Booth's; but this, too, is news to me, as  I never spoke to him in my life, or any of his family.I do hope that the papers which so industriously circulated these  reports connecting me with these damnable deeds, to the very great  injury of my name and reputation, will do me the justice to publish  my release, and the fact of my having been entirely exonerated by  the authorities here, who, after a diligent investigation, could  obtain no evidence that would in the least tarnish my fair  reputation.I feel it but due to the authorities here to state that, while in  the Old Capitol, I was treated with the utmost kindness and  consideration; and was placed in the same quarters assigned to  Governor Vance, Governor Brown, Hon. Mr. Lamar, and others of note.With these few remarks in justice to myself, I will close by  submitting them to the public.Respectfully, Dr. F. Tumblety.[We give the above card from Mr. Tumblety that he may have the full  benefit of his statements where this is known.  When the Doctor was  in Brooklyn the young man who was with him, and who was since  identified with Harold, gave his name indifferently as Farrell and  Blackburn, and the Doctor used the latter name at one time in his  business.  However, as the Doctor has been discharged it is fair to  suppose that he is innocent of any offence against the government.]"

The fact that the victim in every  case has been a fallen woman and an outcast does not tend to  reassure any one, for the fact remains that in this metropolis of  the world, in the latter days of the Nineteenth Century a man of  fiendish propensities is roaming the streets night after night,  committing the most brutal murders at will, and that not all the  London police, led by all the far famed Scotland Yard detectives,  have as yet obtained the first clew to his identity. The two  additional murders of Saturday night have reduced the great city to  a condition of abject terror, and even men may now be found who  declare that they are afraid to venture out after nightfall.So great has been the storm of indignation against the police that  to-day, in pure self defense, they arrested several persons, each  on suspicion of being the wholesale murderer, but no one believes  that the real murderer has been arrested. To-day the Financial  News offered a reward of £300 for the capture of the murderer and  an hour later the Lord Mayor offered a further reward of £500.  Even higher rewards may yet be offered, for until the perpetrator  of the crimes is in custody no one in London will breathe easily.In their terror people wildly run to medical experts for their  opinion, and get nothing. It is generally believed that the  murderer whoever he may be, is skilled in the art of surgery. It  does not take a medical expert to accept that as a fact.Today Dr. Henry Forbes Winslow, Sir Risdon Bennet and other  distinguished physicians gravely announced their latest opinion on  the matter. It was that they are now more than ever convinced that  the murderer is a homicidal lunatic.As that is precisely what every one else is convinced of it simply  goes to show that the medical experts know just as much about the  matter as do the baffled and confused police."
161,index/brooklyn_daily_eagle_18881004.txt,brooklyn_daily_eagle,1888-10-04,"Brooklyn Daily EagleNew York, USA4 October 1888The Tabernacle Pastor on the Whitechapel Murder.Speaking of the Whitechapel atrocities to an EAGLE reporter the  Rev. Dr. Talmage hinted at a possible clew to the apprehension of  the author of these villainies. He suggests the skill in handling  the knife and the knowledge of anatomy that appear upon closely  investigating the nature of the wounds running deeper than the  flesh mutilations as a thread they may lead to the unraveling of  the mystery. The doctor, in referring to the unnecessary fright  that seizes hold of the public upon the most trivial and  unreasonable pretexts, related an incident in which he was the  central figure, which, he says, has not before been printed, and  which he thinks his friends and acquaintances will highly relish.  Dr. Talmage said he had not closely studied the daily reports from  the Whitechapel murders. He described his impressions as follows:""They are no doubt the work of an insane man. Insanity sometimes  pursues the work of arson and sometimes that of assassination. I  have no doubt that the police will very soon apprehend the  perpetrator and lodge him in a place of safety. Murders are often  committed through a desire for pelf (?), but there can be no reason  of that kind assigned here, since the poor creatures he mutilates  have nothing worth stealing.""""How do you account for the mutilation?"" he was asked.""There are no people more systematic in crime than the insane. Each  has a theory of his own as to how the murder ought to be  committed.""""But why has the skill of a surgeon been so adeptly shown?""""Insanity seems sometimes to quicken faculties in certain  directions, while they are benumbed in other ways. If this  laceration has been done as systematically and in a manner implying  surgical skill, as is suggested, it would in my mind suggest a  possible professional pursuit in which the demon had previously  been engaged, and I would suppose that the London constabulary  would follow that line of investigation, as perhaps they are  already doing. I have no doubt the surgical skill shown might  remain and be quickened to a wonderful extent, while the other  faculties are obliterated. A man may be utterly responsible and yet  he may have started in his mind a theory as to how this bloody work  shall be carried on and as to the exact methods to be pursued in  accomplishing it. There have been many cases when, upon  examination, it has been ascertained that the insane have felt that  they were called upon for conducting that especial form of  butchery. It does not, however, imply previous wickedness. The best  men when they have become insane have proved the most diabolical.  The loss of reason is the worst calamity that can befall any one,  because it leaves nothing impossible in the way of depredation,  cruelty and outrage. Some men are born with an intellectual twist  which is greater than the average or they are the victims of a  moral malformation, either of which they may have inherited.""""In what light do you regard the fruitless endeavors of the London  police to terminate these outrages?""""I do not think these murders can in any way be set down against  either London society or the efficiency of the London police, or  that they indicate any general demoralization. It might happen in  any country and the most skilled efforts to prevent its continuance  be foiled. A demon like that in London might dodge in and out of  the alleys of New York City or even Brooklyn without being  arrested. As, witness the Nathan murder and the half massacre of  the New York broker in his own bed chamber; witness fifty other  cases all over the land. There are no finer and more complete  detective and police systems than those of London. People get in  the habit on both sides of blaming the police when offenders are  not immediately caught. My wonder is that, with the acumen  possessed by many of these offenders the police are able to  overtake then as soon as they do. Sometimes crime is epidemic and  breaks out in many different places at the same time and it seems  to be owing to something in the atmosphere. The east wind is the  mother of all sorts of villainies, while the northwest wind is the  most favorable wind for honesty and good order. But this London  affair must not be looked upon as an epidemic, as all the work  appears to be the product of one brain and one hand. I can easily  understand how there should be a feverish and unnatural excitement  as the result of these desperations. When I was residing in  Philadelphia there was considerable excitement over what was called  the India Rubber Man. Women out at night declared that they had  seen man with the most extraordinary jumping capacities, which  seemed to come from extraordinary india rubber appliances or from a  supernatural gift of powers equal to the same. Some had seen him  leap from curb to curb and others had seen him vault over the tops  of houses without any apparent means of assistance. During the  excitement I was absent. One Friday evening I returned home barely  in time to get to prayer meeting. I was, of course, unaware of any  extraordinary event or excitement. It was wet and stormy and hastily  donning my waterproof outfit I hurried down the street at full  speed. Just before reaching the church I met a couple of women. I  turned to pass them, still on a run, when they suddenly threw down  their umbrellas and gave most unearthly screeches. The next moment,  fortunately for me, I appeared under the full glare of a lamp and  they at once recovered self possession and composure. I was, of  course, greatly perplexed that the women should be so frightened over  an inoffending person hurrying along the street to prayer meeting  and I did not fully understand when I heard one of them say, as I  passed by, ""O, I thought it was the India Rubber man.""""Dr. Talmage in concluding added a good word for the police. He said  he never understood that the police more than other human mortals  claimed omnipresence. Their comparatively small numbers in the  cities of New York and Brooklyn make it impossible for them to be  all over at once. he said he had watched the policemen on their  beats at all hours of day and night, going to and from houses of  sickness and trouble, and had never found a man yet off duty or  intoxicated or in anywise acting improperly. Many he knew  personally who were hard working, faithful public servants, good  husbands and kind fathers.Referring to examples of the loss of reason, he said: ""The best and  mightiest had been mentally shipwrecked. Robert Hall, the great  Baptist clergyman of Bristol and of all Christendom, as consecrated  and brilliant a man as the Christian pulpit ever had, had again and  again been incarcerated in the insane asylum. John Brown, the  Scotch essayist, died in a straight jacket, and Alexander Cruden  wrote the Concordance, the greatest work ever prepared beside the  Bible, during his lucid spells and between repeated periods of  incarceration."""

Important political  utterances, which ordinarily would provoke general discussion, are  unread and continental affairs of vital interest to England are  thrust aside as of no consequence whatever. The police have adopted  the theory that the letter and postal card signed ""Jack the Ripper "", sent to the Central News a week ago Thursday, emanated from the  actual murderer. Facsimilies of the letter and card are posted in  every police station and upon every dead wall, accompanied by a  paragraph begging any person recognizing the writing to communicate  with General Sir Charles Warren, Chief Commissioner of the  Metropolitan Police. The Central News received another  communication from ""Jack the Ripper"" yesterday evening announcing  his intention to commit more murder to-night and upon the strength  of this the police have ordered every man on duty and are assisted  by hundreds of amateur detectives. The reign of terror which has  prevailed in the Whitechapel district during the past week still  continues. and the arrival of daylight to-morrow morning will be  hailed with joy by thousands of the denizens of that locality."

The record of these  murders is one of the most startling in the criminal history of any  country, and while many theories have been advanced bearing on the  identity of the culprit, no progress whatever has been made in the  work of running him to ground. It is idle to blame the police and  to institute comparisons between the efficiency of Scotland yard  and that of the detective talent of New York. According to the last  census London had a population of 5,500,000. There is but one  policeman to every 625 people. New York's police force, in  proportion to population, is very much larger, and beside this, as  superintendent Murray points out, our chief city has no locality  that in misery and crime corresponds with the  Whitechapel  district. The common assumption is that  all the murders have been  committed by the same person, and yet there would be no cause for  surprise it it were discovered that such was not the case. However  this may be, there is certainly great danger that the murders will  appeal to disordered minds in other cities, and thus breed a spirit  of slaughter horrible to contemplate. Already it is thought in some  quarters that the fiend is likely to turn up anywhere. The  mysterious disappearance of a woman named Caroline Rose from the  steamer Egypt of the National Line during the vessel's last trip  west is attributed to the Whitechapel murderer because a knife  smeared with blood was found in her berth. All the steerage  passengers, according to the morning papers, were inclined to think  that ""Jack the Ripper"" had been on board.The danger of imitation being duly considered, the fact remains  that probabilities favor a recurrence of the crime in the same part  of London. The series of fifteen butcheries, which the monster is  said to contemplate, is still far from complete. Assuredly of great  significance is it that all the victims belong to the same class of  unfortunate women, for if the gratification of a homicidal mania  was the sole thing in view the sex and character of the stricken  would presumably not be the same in all instances. Rather would  there be reason to infer that a variety of selections would be  shown - that men, women and children from different walks of life  would succumb to the assassin's knife. Something more, then, than  ordinary blood-thirstiness must be premised, and, this admitted,  the theory that the criminal is a reformatory maniac skilled in the  use of the knife, cunning in the extreme, and probably perfectly  sane on all other matters, would appear to be the most tangible. It  has been said among other things that the assassin is an American,  because he wears a slouch hat. If so ghastly a series of tragedies  may be said to possess an element of humor, it is in imputing the  crimes to an American for the reason specified. Much more  reasonable would it be to infer that the murderer is a member or  ex-member of the London police force, who, for some wrong, real or  fancied, seeks to bring ridicule and disgrace on the entire police  machinery of the metropolis. In the absence of a more rational  explanation we prefer to hold to the theory that the murderer  believes he has a sublime moral mission to perform in the  extermination of fallen women, and that it is by no means  improbable that the butcheries are the result of a conspiracy of  similarly affected fanatics.It is difficult to exaggerate the alarm which the horrors have  caused in London. Here is the spectacle of a man killing at will,  taking the keenest delight in his ability to evade detection and  defying all the resources of civilization in his ghastly carnival.  He mocks the detective skill of the proudest city in the world, and  calmly announces that when his list of victims is complete he will  gladly surrender. If there could be anything better calculated to  bring into relief barrenness of ingenuity and resource not only on  the part of the officials but of the whole people, it is not easy  to imagine. Not too much is it to say that one more victim, in view  of the excited condition of the public mind in England, may have  serious effect on the stability of the Ministry. However  unreasonable and unjust it may be the complaint against the  Salisbury administration on the score of its inability to catch the  murderer is so bitter that there will be no cause for surprise if  it were compelled to retire in contempt beneath the lash of general  condemnation. It is time for action, and the authorities of London  can now well afford to turn the city upside down in their endeavors  to allay popular clamor."

The  frequency with which the horrible deeds have been committed have  made people callous to them, and, if it were not for the disgusting  details of yesterday's crime, the present denunciation of the  police department by the press would chronicle the deed, and, after  a brief ruffling of the surface, London's social tide would  continue to ebb and flow in peaceful forgetfulness of the revolting  crime. According to statements made today by the neighbors of the  unfortunate woman, the victim was alive and chatting with her next  door lodger half an hour before her mutilated body was found. The  surgeons, however, who viewed the corpse are unanimous in the  opinion that the woman was murdered between 2 and 3 o'clock in the  morning, thus confirming the first reports of the case.The detectives' inquiries today elicited the statement that the  woman was singing at 1 o'clock in the morning. The same stupid  methods of tracking the criminal are being employed now as in the  former cases.Sir Charles Warren is away on a leave of absence, his present  locality being a mystery. He was last heard from at St. Petersburg.  Urgent telegrams have been sent to him recalling him to his duty,  but they have not reached him as yet. He is believed to be en route  to Moscow now, but no one seems to know where he is. The fact of  his absence has not yet been made public, but there will be a  perfect storm of indignation when it is known.The Cabinet discussed matters relating to the murder touching upon  Commissioner Warren's efficiency for three hours this afternoon,  and it is rumored that they will make a scapegoat of Warren. This  would certainly be a sop to the public and would ward off censure  of the Government for a time at least. The favorite theories  regarding the identity of the murderer seem to be that he is either  the Malay formerly spoken of, or a cattleman attached to some  steamer that makes trips of a week's duration to some European  port. The police incline to the latter supposition. According to  this theory the murderer, after killing his victim, could destroy  all trace of his whereabouts by immediately shipping and not  returning to London for a week or so."

It relates to the Whitechapel murders and pictures  the Ripper as a man who is under oath to rid the community of  fallen women. The one who is killed in the second act  appears to  deserve her fate, because she sings a solo half an hour before the  assassin gets hold of her. After devious meanderings the plot leads  up to the hanging of the Ripper and everybody is contented. the  play needs revision, badly. It is intolerably wordy, the street  scene in Whitechapel is wholly needless and the comedy is weak.  Several variety features and two or three excursions of the  Salvation Army are supposed to give pleasure to the multitude, and  there is a vicious scrapping match between Charles Bogert and  William Nash. The piece is fairly acted and well set."

He first appeared in Brooklyn some ten days ago at the boarding house of Mrs. Helen Lamb, at 204 Washington street.  There he engaged rooms and took his meals.  Apparently he did not work, and informed the landlady that he was an ordinary citizen with plenty of money which he had made years ago from a patent medicine.

He is preparing a book  which he intends to publish at an early date, in the hope that by  showing his true character it will remove the stigma that has been  put upon his name by the many stories published about him in  connection with the work of the murderous London terror.Dr. Tumblety has had a most remarkable career and has traveled all  over this country and Europe.  He was born in Rochester, N.Y., and  at an early age began the practice of medicine in Canada.  Here he  seems to have made many friends and shows letters from Sir E. Head,  Governor of Canada; Hon. Henry Sternes, Mayor of Montreal; Hon.  George Hall, Mayor of Quebec; Hon. John Hutchinson, Mayor of  Hamilton, C.W.; Hon W. Matthews, Mayor of Brantford, C.W.; Hon. W.  Barket, Mayor of London, C.W.Just before the breaking out of the war he went to Washington and  soon became intimate with the leading citizens of that place.  When  General McClellan became commander of the Army of the Potomac he  took Dr. Tumblety under his wing and furnished him with passes to  go and come where and when he pleased.  He remained in Washington  for some time, and seems to have mingled in the best society there.   When he went to London in 1863 President Lincoln gave him a letter  to Lord John Russell recommending him to his kindly attention.  He  visited London, Paris, Berlin and all the large cities of the  Continent, and during the siege of Paris in 1870-1871 became  attached to the ambulance service of France.  For his services he  was presented with the Brittany cross and a diploma.In his book he will publish letters from the late Emperor Napoleon,  Lord Beaconsfield, Earls Derby and Granville, Lord Headley, Sirs  Edward Thornton and Charles R. Dilke, Horace Greeley, J. Gordon  Bennett, Generals Sherman and Lee, John Bright, Charles Dickens and  Professor Willard Parker of New York.  Dr. Tumblety has many  friends in this city who feel aggrieved at the many calumnies that  have been heaped upon him. Among them is Mr. Elisha Henshaw, of 567  Quincy street, who has known him for twenty-four years and who  speaks of him in the highest terms.  The doctor spent many years of  his life in this city, and his friends have promised a hearty  welcome on his return."

This mysterious and fiendish individual has,  according to his promise to kill twenty Whitechapel women, several  more murders to perform, and there is little doubt that last night's  performance is some of his handiwork. The victim killed in castle  alley, Whitechapel, last night was, like the rest of the Ripper's  subjects, an abandoned woman. Her throat was cut through to the  spine, the clothing thrown back, exposing the abdomen, and several  horrible gashes had been made across the stomach. The intestines,  however, were not exposed and no portion of the body is missing, as  was usually the case with the other murders of this description.  Blood was still flowing from the body and the body was warm when it  was found. Since the last murder in Whitechapel several extra  policemen have been stationed in the district, and some of them  have been placed within a hundred yards of the very spot where last  night's murder was committed. More then this, an officer, who, with  a watchman employed to watch a large warehouse nearby, must have  been within a few yards of the murderer when he struck the victim,  did not hear any noise of a suspicious nature. An old clay pipe,  smeared with blood, which was found lying beside the murdered  woman, is the only clew the police possess, and it quite possible  that the pipe belonged to the victim herself. Several arrests have  been made of suspicious persons, but the prisoners have all been  discharged. As usual the police are as much in the dark as the  public and are working up every possible clew. They have placed a  cordon around the immediate district and are searching houses,  alleys and every place which suggests itself as the hiding place of  the murderer.The newspapers unanimously declare that the work is that of Jack  the Ripper and call upon Commissioner Monro, of the Metropolitan  Police, to do better work in this case than was done by his  predecessor, Sir Charles Warren.It isstated that a letter was received by the police officials  before last night's murder in Whitechapel signed ""Jack the Ripper"",  in which the writer said he was ""about to resume his work."""

London, September 10.At 5:30 o'clock this morning a policeman found the body of an  abandoned woman lying in a corner of a railway arch spanning Cable  street, in Whitechapel. Examination of the body showed that the  head and legs had been cut off and carried away, the abdomen ripped  open, leaving the intestines lying upon the ground. The police  authorities immediately placed a cordon of officers around the  spot, but no arrests were made. A policeman passed the spot where  the body was found every fifteen minutes throughout the night and  saw nothing to arouse his suspicions.Physicians who examined the body believe that the murder occupied  nearly an hour and it is surmised that the murderer carried the  head and legs away in a a bag. The murder is the most horrible of  the whole Whitechapel series. The dissection of the body showed  that the perpetrator possessed considerable surgical skill. The  murdered woman was about thirty years of age and was evidently  addicted to excessive use of spiritous liquors. Her clothing  was  shabby. As yet she has not been identified. The murder has created  tremendous excitement and a large crowd of agitated humanity  surrounds the morgue, whither the body was taken.Further examination reveals the fact that there was no blood on the  ground where the body was found, nor was there any indication of a  struggle. This confirms the general belief that the woman was  murdered in a house and her body taken to the spot where it was  discovered. The trunk was nude and a torn and bloody chemise was  lying near it. Experts are of the opinion that the woman was killed  two days ago.Three sailors were, subsequent to the discovery of the body, found  sleeping in the adjoining arch. They were arrested, but convinced  the police that they had neither seen nor heard anything of the  murder or the body lying near them and were discharged."

She was found lying on her back with the head nearly  severed from her body. There was also a severe wound on the back of  her head, caused, it is thought, by the severe fall she experienced  when her assailant knocked her down.The scene of this possibly latest of the series of ""Jack the  Ripper's"" crimes is a dark, narrow archway known as Swallow's  gardens and leading from Little Mint street to Chambers street. The  archway referred to is, during the busy hours, a well frequented  thoroughfare, especially used by railway employees and stablemen in  passing to and from their residences in and about that packed  neighborhood to their work on the numerous lines of railroads or in  the many stables scattered about that section of the city.At all times of the night there are people awake in the houses and  pedestrians passing about and through Swallow's gardens, but nobody  seems to have heard any cries of an alarming nature during the  early hours this morning, when the crime was committed.The murdered woman, judging from her appearance, belonged to the  abandoned class, and was fairly well dressed. Though her hair was  untidy her clothing had not been disarranged. The police theory is  that the woman was murdered while in a standing position; that the  crime was probably the work of ""Jack the Ripper"". and that the  murderer was frightened away by the approach of some pedestrian  before he had time to mutilate the body in the manner already  described in the previous crimes attributed to ""Jack the Ripper.""On the other hand, it is known that the residents of Whitechapel in  particular and of London in general are prone to give credit to "" Jack the Ripper"" for any murder or attempt at murder in  Whitechapel, where a woman is concerned.The body, after the usual formalities taken with the object of  establishing the woman's identity and of finding a clue to the  murderer had been gone through with in the usual stereotyped  manner, was taken to the Whitechapel mortuary. The blood was still  warm when the body was found. When the blood stains had been  cleared awy the police carved a rough cross in the wood work over  the spot in Swallow's gardens where the unfortunate woman was  found, in order to mark the spot where the crime was perpetrated.  Large crowds of people, naturally, gathered around Swallow's  gardens this morning in spite of the heavy efforts of scores of  detectives and of uniformed and plain clothes police of the  division. There seems to be, as in so many other and similar cases,  no definite clew to the murderer. No arrests have been made.A railroad employee, it is true, says he saw the murdered woman  talking to a man, apparently a foreign seaman, just previous to the  time the murder is supposed to have been committed, and the police  are now engaged in searching all the vessels lying in the Thames or  in the many docks about the port of London. The policeman who found  the murdered woman must have reached the spot while the murderer  was only a few yards away, for the woman's lips were still  twitching nervously and her eyes were still rolling when the  officer bent over her and a moment later sounded his whistle in a  call for assistance, which must have placed any policeman in the  neighborhood on the alert.A woman's hat was found near the scene of the murder concealed by a  piece of drapery. This hat was, in addition to the one on the  murdered woman's head, suggestive, according to the London police,  that either the ""Ripper"" or the woman was disguised.The spot where the murdered woman's body was found was not a  stone's throw from a police station.Upon being questioned by his superior officer, the policeman who  found the body said that, in addition to the nervous twitching of  the lips and the rolling of the eyes already referred to, the  woman's limbs were moving when he found her. Consequently, she must  have been still alive when the policeman bent over her. The officer  added that as soon as he discovered that a crime had been committed  he rushed to the end of the archway and sounded an alarm with his  whistle, while the ""Ripper"" must have escaped through the  neighboring streets. A large number of people who were immediately  attracted to the scene of the murder by the police alarm assisted  the scores of officers who soon appeared in searching the  neighboring doorways, alleyways, dark nooks and corners where a man  could conceal himself.The wound across the murdered woman's throat was evidently caused  by a sharp, powerful stroke, and nothing can shake the belief of  the police that but for the approach of some pedestrian, possibly  the policeman who found the body, would have been mutilated in a  manner similar to that of the other Whitechapel murders.The woman found murdered in Swallow's gardens has been identified  as an unfortunate known as ""Carroty Nell"".LATER: The police have arrested a man on suspicion of being  concerned in the murder of the unfortunate woman.

The inquiries made by the police  concerning the prisoner show that he has been absent from England  eighteen months, or about the period since the last Whitechapel  murder.A woman who is detained as a witness asserts that she saw the  prisoner quarreling with the murdered woman early in the evening  before the crime was committed.A policeman who was on duty Friday night and morning on the streets  about Tower hill and in the vicinity of the crime has identified  the prisoner as a man he met about a quarter of an hour after the  murder. The policeman, noticing that the man had blood on his  clothes, stopped him on Tower hill and asked several questions as  to how the blood stains happened to be on his garments. The man,  according to the policeman, replied that he had been assaulted  while passing through a street in the neighborhood of the docks.  The policeman not being aware that a murder had been committed and  not having heard the alarm whistles from the police, who had  evidently then reached the scene of the murder, allowed himself to  be satisfied that the blood stained man was telling the truth and  so allowed him to pass on his way.The prisoner's face is badly scratched, as if by a woman's finger  nails. In reply to questions as to how he came by these scratches  the man said that he was so injured when he was assaulted near the  docks. The prisoner stoutly denies having at any time met the  murdered woman. He will be confronted with the railroad employee  and with others who may have seen the man who is supposed to have  been in company with ""Carroty Nell"" on Friday night.THE WHITECHAPEL ATROCITYThe police seem confident that they have at last nabbed the  notorious Jack the Ripper, but the general public is skeptical as  to the fact of the sailor man with the bloody clothing being the  hero of the dozen murders which have preceded that of Francis  Coleman (sic). It is quite likely that he committed the last crime,  but there is nothing to connect him with the long series of  similar atrocities which have terrorized the Whitechapel district.  The police authorities are being censured for having relaxed the  vigilance with which, until recently, the district haunted by the  Ripper was guarded. The last crime is attributed to this  negligence, just as the long immunity from these horrors since the  last previous butchery is attributed to the extreme activity of the  officials. It seems like pretty good evidence of the correctness of  this theory that it was only a fortnight ago that the precaution of  wearing rubber boots was given up by the patrolmen of the district.  The noiselessness with which the constables went their rounds made  such murders as that of ""Carroty Nell"" impossible, or too risky to  be attempted even by the daring ""Jack."" But the sound of an  officer's approaching steps, audible a long distance at night,  served as a guide to the whereabouts of the minion of the law, and  made crime comparatively easy. the newspapers are full of letters  from citizens offering various suggestions for the benefit of the  police in their search for the murderer. Few of these are original,  most of the proposals having been brought forward at the time of  the former excitement over the same matter. The Star takes this  occasion to advocate the redemption of the poverty stricken and  crime ridden masses, as the only cure for such monstrous crimes. It  declares that the realization of General Booth's scheme for the  improvement of the condition of the lower classes is less of a  dream than is the extinction of such criminals as ""Jack the Ripper "", so long as the mass of misery and wretchedness on which such  criminals thrive is left to exist."

The police now have in their possession a sharp, dangerous looking  knife, stained with blood and showing traces of having recently  been washed. The blood stains were examined microscopically by Dr.  Phillips, the police surgeon attached to the Leman street police  station. Dr. Phillips has no doubt that the stains are those of  human blood. This formidable knife has been traced to the  possession of Sadler, who, as already stated, was a fireman on  board a steamer which recently arrived from Turkey.The police have no doubt that Sadler was the murderer of ""Carroty  Nell."""
190,index/brooklyn_daily_eagle_18910416.txt,brooklyn_daily_eagle,1891-04-16,"Brooklyn Daily EagleNew York, USA16 April 1891BYRNES NAMES THE MANA Police Statement Regarding ""Jack the Ripper.""Inspector Byrnes made a statement last night in which he says he  believes the old woman known as Shakespeare, who was murdered and  mutilated Thursday night in the East River hotel, at the corner of  Catharine and Water streets, New York, was the victim of a man  known as ""Frenchy"". The man's cousin, George Francois, is a  prisoner and is held as a witness. The police say the man who did  the deed is still at large. The cousin is also known as ""Frenchy.""  A mysterious prisoner was brought to police headquarters yesterday  afternoon. There are reasons to suppose that this man is the one  who killed the old woman. It was after this man was brought to  police headquarters that Inspector Byrnes made the statement. It  was type written and was read by Acting Inspector McLaughlin at the  Oak street station house and in the presence of Inspector Byrnes.  It is incomplete, but neither Inspector Byrnes nor Captain  McLaughlin would answer any of a number of questions put by  reporters to cover the deficiencies.The statement sets forth that Mary Miniton, the housekeeper at the  East river hotel, admits that she had known the murdered woman for  a number of years. She was known to her both as Shakespeare and as  Jeff Davis. Frenchy, the man under arrest, admits that on the night  previous to the murder he occupied a room with Shakespeare in the  East river hotel and that he was in the hotel, but not in the room  with the woman, the night she was murdered. The man suspected of  having committed the murder is also known as Frenchy, and is  believed to be this man's cousin because the several women held as  witnesses say the two men spoke of each other as cousins. The  Frenchy who is held as a witness refuses to give any information  regarding the missing man who is known to be a native of Assyria.  He speaks an Arabic-French dialect. He was arrested January 24 last  for biting Mary Lopez, one of the women now held as a witness. He  was her companion in the east river hotel the night he bit the  woman. All the women held as witnesses knew him and could identify  him. He has been known to the inmates of low dives in the Fourth  ward for several months.This is all the police would say about the murderer. They have  looked up the history of the wretched old woman who was so  shockingly murdered. They say of her that she first appeared in New  York about fifteen years ago. She was then a fine looking woman, of  middle age, very intelligent and quite refined, though addicted to  drink. Because of her intelligence she came to be known as  Shakespeare. Why she was also dubbed Jeff Davis no one seems to  know. She became very popular among those with whom she associated  because of her liberality and for her superior intelligence. She  had plenty of money, and when under the influence of liquor she  would spend it freely or would give it away. She rapidly sunk, and  soon became as low as the lowest of the women in Water street,  although she would frequently disappear and when she returned she  would seem to have suspended her drinking and other low habits  while absent. She returned periodically to her low companions in  the low water street dives.Detective Crowley, the statement continued, discovered a woman who  knew Shakespeare well and who informed the detective that her name  was Croline Montgomery and that in early life she became the wife a  Captain James Brown, who sailed a ship from Salem, Mass., where  they lived. Captain Brown died and left her a fortune. She came to  New York shortly after her  husband's death and settled in a  respectable part of the Fourth ward. She had then become a victim  of liquor and when under its influence she drifted to the low dives  a few blocks away. The women of these places made her very welcome  because of her money and she soon spent most of her time with them.  She has often been arrested and sent to Blackwell's Island. When  she disappeared from her chums she was an inmate of an old womens'  home, where her board was paid by a relative named Lawson, who is a  resident of Salem. She was last discharged from the Blackwell's  Island prison a few days ago. Her two daughters, Ellen and Annie,  still live at Salem.The above is the statement given by the police. When questions were  asked about the previous history of Frenchy it was said that there  was nothing more to say than what had been said.Every dive in the Fourth ward has been visited by detectives, and  when the EAGLE reporter went to those places to get information  about the man who is suspected, the dive keepers said they had  never heard of him, although they had told the reporter before that  they knew him well.The mysterious prisoner at police headquarters was brought in by  Captain Reilly and Detective Britt of the Nineteenth precinct and  Detective Sergeant Hanley of the Central office. His hands were  tied behind him and he was closely guarded by the three officers.  He reached headquarters, on Mulberry street, at 3:50 p.m. Later he  was taken to the Oak street station house. He answered the  description given by Mary Miniter of the man who occupied the room  with Mrs. Brown the night she was murdered. His clothing was the  same as  that given by Mary, with the exception of the trousers,  which were different from those worn by the man Thursday night.It was stated in yesterday's EAGLE that a policeman brought a pair of  trousers that were stained with blood to the Fourth precinct police  station yesterday morning, and that he spoke of having got them at  a Bowery lodging house. The police refused to speak of these  trousers. The fact that the mysterious prisoner answered the  description of the wanted man in all particulars except as to the  trousers, would indicate that after having killed the woman the  murderer went to a Bowery lodging house, and finding that some of  his victim's blood was on his trousers he secured another pair,  leaving the bloodstained pair behind him. When Inspector Byrnes was  asked about this mysterious prisoner he replied: ""O, he is a small  thief we have wanted for a long time. I assure you he is a bum.""  But he would not say who the small thief was or why a police  captain and two detectives guarded him so closely and had his hands  pinioned.Deputy Coroner Jenkens (sic) who made the autopsy on the body of  the murdered woman, was seen by a reporter of the EAGLE after he  had finished his scientific examination. He said: ""I do not claim,  as had been reported, that the slashing must have been done by a  left handed man, or that I am sure she was cut before she was dead.  That she was strangled there is no doubt, but whether she was cut  before she died from strangulation or immediately after death no one  can tell. It is evident that great force was used in the clutch at  her throat. The liquid condition of the blood in the heart would  indicate that strangulation and not hemorrhage caused death, and  yet the amount of bleeding would indicate that she was not quite  dead or at least that the body was still warm when she was cut. I  found one long incision from the top of the right hip bone  descending obliquely across the abdomen to the bubes (sic). The  intestines protruded from this cut. It appears that after the cut  was made the body was turned over and the cut was continued from  the pubes upward and backward beyond the base of the backbone.  There are also two long scratches in front and a perfect cross  scratched in the skin at the back of the thigh.""""Was the cutting such as would have been done by a surgeon as the  cutting done by Jack the Ripper of London, is said to be?"" asked  the reporter.""If it was done by a surgeon he was a butcher. It was horrible  hacking.""""Would you suppose this murder was committed by the London Jack the  Ripper?""""I am not advancing theories. I cannot say.""Water and Cherry streets have not witnessed so quiet a Saturday  night as last night in many years. The Fourth ward was overrun with  detectives and the fallen women seemed to be more afraid of them  than they did of Jack the Ripper. The dives were all open, as  usual, but the women kept indoors. The east river hotel was doing a  big business and the low patrons of the house indulged in coarse  jokes about the awful tragedy that was enacted there two night  before.Inspector Byrnes seemed more at ease after Captain Reilly's  prisoner had been brought in. His detectives were still busy  rushing about the Fourth ward, but he returned to his normal  condition of self confidence. The general opinion of those about  police headquarters were that he had his man, but wanted to fasten  the crime upon him without a doubt before he would speak of his  catch.Captain O'Connor of the Oak street station strengthened the belief  that the murderer, or at least the man suspected, had been arrested  by announcing to the reporters shortly before midnight that they  might go home, because he said: ""I assure you that no information  will be given our before tomorrow afternoon. Even if we got the man  we are looking for there would be so many things to clear up that  nothing could be given for publication before tomorrow afternoon.""  Steve Brody seems desirous of getting all the cheap notoriety he  can out of this case. He announced yesterday that he could tell who  the murdered woman was, and he had a statement printed in a New  York paper about her life, which proved to be untrue. Then he told  reporters that his wife had found parts of the intestines of a  woman in the street, near the scene of the murder, and that he had  sent them to the police at the Oak street station. The police  denied that they had received anything from Brody, but Deputy  Coroner Jenkins admitted that the police had sent him a package and  he examined the contents, which proved to be parts of the organs of  a cat."

Patrolman Fourstripes, who is regarded as an authority by  the younger men in his precinct, sat smoking in the muster room  when the news was received. Taking the pipe from his mouth the old  man remarked:""I knew that the boys down town weren't dead by a long shot. Of  course they were bound to catch the man sooner or later. I tell  you, young fellows, Byrnes isn't in it.""No one doubted that the Central office men had captured Jack the  Ripper and when later it was learned that the detectives had three  prisoners in custody much surprise was expressed. Patrolman  Fourstripes was again appealed to. He said:""Rest easy. The boys know what they are doing.""But the detectives had not arrested Jack the Ripper. Mahoney ( recently transferred from the Seventeenth precinct) and Price were  at the ferry station of the Kings county road about 6 o'clock when  they saw four lads jostling men in the crowd. No sooner, allege the  detectives, did one of the youngsters catch sight of them than he  cried: ""Lamm"" and all ran. They gave their pedigrees as follows:  John Wilson, varnisher, 424 West Fourth street, New York, age 23;  Thomas Moran, laborer, 85 Newark avenue, Jersey City, age 18; James  H Thompson, age 17, 146 West Broadway, New York. Thompson had $66  in his possession, the others a couple of dollars each. This  morning the alleged pickpockets were arraigned in the Adams street  court.""Have you any evidence against these men? "" asked the justice.""No, sir,"" was Mahoney's reply, ""but we would like them held on a  charge of vagrancy until we can find out something about them.""The justice looked at the prisoners and after a pause said:""Well, I'll give you until tomorrow morning to get evidence against  them."" And the boys were sent to jail."
192,index/brooklyn_daily_eagle_18910424.txt,brooklyn_daily_eagle,1891-04-24,"Brooklyn Daily EagleNew York, USA24 April 1891IS JACK HERE?A Murder Like One of the Ripper's.Jack the Ripper or someone who closely imitates him in his butchery  of fallen women in the lowest resorts, made his appearance in New  York last night. At about 11 o'clock last evening, a man and a  woman, the latter a drunken wretch, whose haunts were in the lowest  parts of the Fourth ward across the river, applied at a dive on the  southwest corner of Water street and Catharine slip for lodgings,  and on a dirty book the man, who was unknown, wrote ""Knicloi and  wife."" They went to the room at once and nothing more was thought  of them until this morning. At about 10 o'clock today the  individual who is known as clerk of the hotel, rapped on the door  of the room occupied by the couple, but got no answer. The clerk  broke in the door and the sight that met his gaze will probably  never be forgotten by him. On the bed lay the woman dead, her  abdomen ripped open. He ran downstairs for assistance, and the  police were notified. When they reached the place and saw the body  they agreed  that the deed was very much like one of Jack the  Ripper's murders. Part of the woman's viscera had apparently been  carried off. Nobody could be found who had ever seen the woman's  companion before, while everybody seemed to have known the poor  wretch whose body, so horribly cut, lay upon the bed. The butchery  had evidently been done with a dull broken table knife that was  found on a table in the room. The woman's head was bandaged, but it  was not easy to tell why. A cloth had been tied around her neck and  face. Only a very imperfect description of the murderer could be  given to the detectives, and no one had seen him since he went up  to the room with the woman last night. He had probably escaped  during the night after killing her. All that the clerk could tell  was that the man was about 32 years of age, and shabbily dressed.  The police arrested an old crony of the dead woman in hope that  something might be learned of the stranger, but she was too drunk  to talk coherently. She was locked up.The murdered woman is about five feet in height and of slim build.  Her hair is gray and her features, although bloated from  dissipation, show some traces of beauty. She was dressed in dark  clothes and a brown cape was found on the floor. She must have been  about 60 years of age. In the room there was no evidence of a  struggle. From appearances the woman must have been strangled while  asleep with the cloth about her neck. Then he must have taken the  knife and butchered her.Before going to the room last night the woman went into the bar room  and told Mary Mineter, one of the chambermaids, that she was the  daughter of a sea captain named Charles E Brown or Breen."
193,index/brooklyn_daily_eagle_18910425.txt,brooklyn_daily_eagle,1891-04-25,"Brooklyn Daily EagleNew York, USA25 April 1891The ""Jack the Ripper"" ButcheryThe police of the Second precinct in Brooklyn this morning arrested  a man on suspicion of being the perpetrator of the horrible ""Jack  the Ripper"" murder in New York, but investigation showed they were  mistaken, and the prisoner was released. Whether the person  responsible for this most fiendish atrocity is the one who, within  the past few months, has spread terror throughout London, is yet to  be demonstrated. but there is an apparent similarity of motive, and  the attendant circumstances are so strikingly identical that those  inclined to believe that ""Jack the Ripper"" is really here may very  readily be pardoned. Certainly if the murderer is merely an  imitator of the wretch who has shed so much blood in the  Whitechapel districts of London, he has patterned his course so  closely after that of his model that it is hard to detect any  material difference. Beyond doubt, the atrocity is the most  revolting that in recent years, at least, has been presented to the  gaze of the people of New York and Brooklyn, accustomed as they are  to deeds of violence and bloodshed.The main question, of course, relates to the degree of energy and  ability to be displayed by the police in capturing the assassin.  Whether or not the New York police authorities have distinctly  affirmed that the Whitechapel butcheries could not possibly have  been committed in the American metropolis without the murderer  being caught is now a disputed point; at all events, there has been  a general expression of confidence in our superior detective skill,  and this has led to the belief that the perpetrator of the London  horrors could not escape detection on this side of the ocean. Here,  then, is a superb opportunity for the vindication of that  sentiment. Inspector Byrnes and his men cannot claim that the task  which has fallen to their lot is any more difficult than that which  puzzled the Scotland Yard detectives, for, as a matter of fact,  they have several things in their favor which the English policemen  were denied. No matter at what cost of money or energy, or how  drastic the methods employed, the murderer, it is to be hoped, will  be captured before he claims another victim.  MANY ARRESTSBut No Identification of ""Jack the Ripper.""  That the man who butchered the wretched old creature known as  Shakespeare in the East River hotel is ""Jack the Ripper"" of London  Coroner Shultz, who has charge of the case, has but little doubt.  He believes the London fiend has visited New York and has begun a  series of butcheries here such as those committed by him in London.  Whether it is or is not ""Jack the Ripper"" the New York butcher  seems thus far to have completely covered his tracks, and Inspector  Byrnes may not be able to show the police of London how easily he  could catch the man who gave them so much trouble over there.The old woman, who was known only as Shakespeare among her cronies  in the slums of Water street, was a woman far superior in many ways  to those with whom she associated. She was nicknamed Shakespeare  because of her knowledge of literature. It was stated in a New York  morning paper that it had been ,earned that she was an old hanger  on on the low resorts of the east side. Coroner Shultz says this is  not so. He believes he knows who she is, but he will not tell her  name at present. He said to a reporter of the EAGLE: ""This woman  has occupied a good position in life. She was a domestic recently  but was brought down to that level because of her love for drink.  She was well connected and well educated. She was not the Mary  Brown described in the morning paper. I do not wish to say who she  was at present. It will come out later.""""Do you think she was killed by Jack the Ripper?"" asked the  reporter.""I believe this case is the same as those of London. In this case  the murderer first strangled his victim and then mutilated the  body. There are plain marks of his thumb and fingers on her throat.  It would appear she was so drunk that she could offer but little  resistance. he bought her some ale, which she probably drank and  then fell off into a drunken stupor when he deliberately strangled  her. He wound her clothing about her head, but whether this was  done before or after he choked her I do not know. It may be that he  did this first, believing that in her drunken sleep she would thus  be strangled and that as she continued to breath he hastened her  death by chocking her with a clutch of his fingers on her throat.  It is certain that she was dead before she was cut. The fellow  hacked her body much as the bodies of the London victims of Jack  the Ripper were hacked. The cut was from the base of the spine up  across the abdomen to the breast bone. It was made with the knife  found in the room. It was such a cut as must have been made slowly  and deliberately. It would appear as though the murderer had pulled  the intestines out and spread them on the bed. Then he turned the  body over and with the point of his knife scratched a cross on the  skin of the left thigh. I do not see any reason to suppose that the  crime may not have been committed by the fiend of London.""Inspector Byrnes is doing detective in person, and he has every  available man in the department on the case. As soon as he found  that it was possible that ""Jack the Ripper"" was operating, he set  to work with all the machinery at his command to run down the  murderer. He put out his drag net in the Fourth ward and soon had a  big catch at the Fourth precinct station house, on Oak street,  where he had made his headquarters. Each prisoner brought in was  closely questioned. Many of them were allowed to depart. It was  thought that George Francois, who is known as ""Frenchy"" among the  inmates of the low dives, might be the man. The fellow had no  difficult in proving that he occupied another room in the same  house on the night of the murder. He was held as a witness, as were  William Bekker, Mary Healey, Lizzie Carter, Mary Lopez, Alice  Sullivan and Mary Minite (sic).Mary Healey was the chum of the dead woman. She was too drunk to  tell what she knew when arrested. The police are too cautious to  tell what she told when she sobered up. William Behken (sic) is  considered to be an important witness. What he knows the police  will not tell. Inspector Byrnes ran down New Chambers street and  rushed into the Oak street police station at 11 o'clock this  morning. He disappeared into Captain O'Connor's private office and  soon reappeared, followed by a detective. The latter did not move  as rapidly as the inspector seemed to think he should and the  inspector lost his temper and scolded at the man for not hastening.  The two rushed to the city hall station of the elevated railroad  and went uptown.Inspector Byrnes has not slept since he learned of the murder  yesterday morning, and he has been rushing about just as he rushed  in and out of the Oak street station house, ever since. Everything  that looks like an important clew receives his personal attention.  He is on trial before the world, and he seems to know it. The  morning newspapers published dispatches telling of the joy in  Scotland Yard because of his inability to catch this man after he  had boasted that ""Jack the Ripper"" could not do in New York what he  had done in London. The inspector has a large acquaintance with  crooks and thieves.It has been his policy to not prosecute a thief for a petty offense  if he believed by not doing so he could use the petty thief in  helping to convict one guilty of a more serious offense. He would  take the petty thief into his office, draw a confession from him  and then advise him to be honest in the future and let him go. A  watch would be set on this man and the inspector would soon know  who his companions were. If one of his companions was suspected of  a crime the petty thief would be brought to the inspector and he  would be given to understand that the only way he could escape  imprisonment for his old offense would be by helping the police in  the more important case. He would help the police. Nine out of ten  on the block of Water street which terminates at the East river  hotel have been guilty of some petty offenses that the inspector  knows of. Each of these is an assistant of the police in this case,  but none of them seems to be able to give any information that will  lead to the discovery of the butcher. He seems to have come from no  one knows where and to have slipped away without having formed any  acquaintances among the people of the dives of Water or Cherry  street. There is no other part of New York that resembles the  Whitechapel district of London as Water street does. The hovels  here are filthy, low places whose income is derived entirely from  drunken sailors. The women who lure sailors into the dive are  wretched creatures. The only men other than drunken sailors who go  to these places are pert thieves who help the women rob sailors.  These are dens of vice that are not gilded. The houses of infamy  are dirty, wretched places. It is just such a place as this that "" Jack the Ripper"" would select to operate in should he be in New  York. The man who committed this deed evidently studied his ground  well. The saloon under the East River hotel closes at 1 o'clock in  the morning, although after that hour drinks are sold to those who  occupy rooms. ""Shakespeare"" and her murderer entered this house  before midnight. The murderer could not have gone out either  through the hotel entrance or through the saloon without having  asked someone to unlock a door. No one unlocked a  door for him. He  could and probably did leave the place through a window from which  he could step to a low shed from which he could drop to the street.  The facts that he knew of this way of escape and that none of the  people of the neighborhood knows who he was strengthens the belief  that he is a man who secretly studied the ground for some time  before attempting to commit the crime.The low women of the neighborhood believe the ""Ripper"" is among  them and they are terrorized.Deputy Coroner Jenkins had the body of the murdered woman  photographed this morning. He was to have made an autopsy when the  photographer had completed his work.A mysterious fire occurred in the East River hotel this morning.  The kerosene lamp in the housekeeper's room on the second floor  fell over and set fire to the carpet. The flames were extinguished  before any damage was done. It is not known how the lamp was  overturned. It would be possible for someone to climb to the top of  the sheds and reach the lamp with a walking cane.Mounted Patrolman Frank of the Tenth precinct yesterday afternoon  discovered two tramps, one of whom bore a striking resemblance to  the man described as the New York ""Jack the Ripper"". The fellows  were arrested for lounging and taken to the Sixth avenue station.  There they were held until this morning when Justice Walsh sent  them to jail as vagrants.The prisoner, whose resemblance to the New York murderer was most  striking, gave his name as John Foley and said he lived in Newark,  N.J. His companion claimed to be Frank McGovern of the same place.A description of the man was sent to New York police headquarters  and this morning Inspector Byrnes came to Brooklyn and paid his  respects to Superintendent Campbell. From the description given the  Inspector by the superintendent the former decided that Foley was  not the man he wanted.In his talk with the chief the New York official said that his  great difficulty so far was found in the fact that all the people  who could give him any information were so drunk as to be useless.  When they become sober the inspector hopes to learn something of  value in his hunt for the murderer. The inspector said further that  he thought the man was not in Brooklyn. Nevertheless, a description  has been sent to all the stations and the whole Brooklyn police  department is on the lookout for the criminal. A policeman brought a pair of trousers, on which there were blood  spots, to the Fourth precinct station house this morning. They are  believed to belong to George Francois. The police refuse to speak of  this clue.At 2 o'clock Deputy Coroner Jenkins had proceeded far enough with  the autopsy to state that he believed the mutilation of the body  had been begun before life was extinct. He found also that a part  of the intestine had been carried away.Brooklyn got whiff of the ""Jack the Ripper"" excitement this morning  and a man was detained for two hours at the Second precinct station  house on the suspicion that he might be the murderer of the Water  street, New York woman.   The arrest was made by Detective Sergeant Carney of the Second  precinct. He was starting for his breakfast about 7 o'clock when he  saw, lounging on the corner of Fulton and Hicks streets, a man  answering the general printed description of the New York murderer.  He was about five feet eight inches high, about 30 years old, had  the prominent light mustache which is the most certain feature of  the murderer's description, he wore a similar shabby and battered  derby hat and dark and soiled clothes, and, last of all  circumstances, he was just beginning to recover from a drunk (sic).  As Sergeant Carney noted these confirmatory details his heart  jumped at the chance that he had got the real ""Jack the Ripper"" and  his hand was quickly on the lounger's collar. The prisoner didn't  object. He seemed to be used to that sort of thing and he went  across Fulton street to the station house readily enough. Sergeant  McCarthy was at the desk and Sergeant Craney communicated his  suspicions. Sergeant McCarthy put the prisoner through the usual  catechism with some care. The man said that his name was Frederick  Straube, age 26 years, nationality German and trade butcher. He  said he was out of work and had been sleeping in the cheap lodging  houses, for the last two nights in the People's hotel, at Fulton  and Hicks streets. Sergeant McCarthy explained to the man why he  had been brought in and the prisoner's face at once brightened. He  said he hadn't been near Water street and he knew he should have no  trouble in establishing his whereabouts. He made no objection to  waiting until the New York police could be notified, and sat down  and smoked a pipe in an inner room as though he found the  atmosphere of a station house preferable to that of a saloon. The  New York headquarters was notified, and at 9 o'clock Detective  Sergeant McNaughton of Inspector Byrnes' staff reached the station  house with Mary Billiter (sic). Mary Billiter opened the door of  the East River hotel on Thursday night for the murdered woman, took  the name of the man who was with her and saw the couple as they  went upstairs. She is the only person who has seen the murderer and  her identification may be very important. As soon as she saw Strube  (sic) she said he was not so heavy as the murderer, and not quite  so tall. She was positive that they had the wrong man and Strube  was discharged. The register of the People's hotel shows that  Strube slept there Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights. Twice the  name was written Strube and once Strauver by the book keeper, but  every time he had room 15 and paid 25 cents for it. The book  keeper's description of his lodger fits Strube perfectly, and there  is no chance that the police have let the murderer slip through  their fingers."

The man's cousin, George Francois, is a prisoner and is held as a witness. The police say the man who did the deed is still at large. The cousin is also known as Frenchy. A mysterious prisoner was brought to police headquarters yesterday afternoon. There are reasons to suppose that this man is the one who killed the old woman. It was after this man was brought to police headquarters that Inspector Byrnes made the statement. It was typewritten and was read by Acting Inspector McLaughlin at the Oak street station house and in the presence of Inspector Byrnes. It is incomplete, but neither Inspector Byrnes nor captain McLaughlin would any answer any of a number of questions put by reporters to cover the deficiencies.The statement sets forth that Mary Miniton, the housekeeper at the East River hotel, admits that she had known the murdered woman for a number of years. She was known to her both as Shakespeare and as Jeff Davis. Frenchy, the man under arrest, admits that on the night previous to the murder, he occupied a room with Shakespeare in the East River hotel and that he was in the hotel, but not in the room with the woman the night she was murdered. The man suspected of having committed the murder is also known as Frenchy, and is believed to be this man's cousin because the several women held as witnesses say the two men spoke to each other as cousins. The Frenchy who is held as a witness refuses to give any information regarding the missing man who is known to be a native of Assyria. He speaks an Arabic French dialect. He was arrested January 24 last for biting Mary Lopez, one of the women now held as a witness. He was her companion in the East River hotel the night he bit the woman. All the women held as witnesses knew him and could identify him. He has been known to the inmates of low dives in the Fourth ward for several months.    This is all the police would say about the murderer. They have looked up the history of the wretched old woman who was so shockingly murdered. They say of her that she first appeared in New York about fifteen years ago. She was then a fine looking woman, of middle age, very intelligent and quite refined, though addicted to drink. Because of her intelligence she came to be known as Shakespeare. Why she was also dubbed Jeff Davis no one seems to know. She became very popular among those with whom she associated because of her liberality and for her superior intelligence. She had plenty of money, and when under the influence of liquor she would spend it freely or would give it away. She rapidly sank, and soon became as low as the lowest of the women in Water street, although she would frequently disappear and when she returned would seem to have suspended her drinking and other low habits while absent. She returned periodically to her companions in the low water street dives.Detective Crowley, the statement continued, discovered a woman who knew Shakespeare well and who informed the detective that her name was Caroline Montgomery and that in early life she had become the wife of Captain James brown, who sailed a ship from Salem, Mass., where they lived. Captain Brown died and left her a fortune. She came to New York shortly after her husband's death and settled in a respectable part of the Fourth ward. She had then become a victim of liquor and when under its influence she drifted to the low dives a few blocks away. The women of these places made her very welcome because of her money and she soon spent most of her time with them. She has often been arrested and sent to Blackwell's Island. When she disappeared from her chums she was an inmate of an old women's home, where her board was paid by a relative named Lawson, who is a resident of Salem. She was last discharged from the Blackwell's Island prison a few days ago. Her two daughters, Ellen and Annie, still live in Salem.The above is the statement given by the police. When questions were asked about the previous history of Frenchy it was said that there was nothing more to say than what had been said.Every dive in the Fourth ward has been visited by detectives, and when The Eagle reporter went to those places to get information about the man who is suspected, the dive keepers said they had never heard of him, although they had told the reporter before that they knew him well.The mysterious prisoner at police headquarters was brought in by Captain Reilly and Detective Britt of the Nineteenth precinct and Detective Sergeant Hanley of the Central office. His hands were tied behind him and he was closely guarded by the three officers. He reached headquarters on Mulberry street at 3.50 p.m. Later he was taken to the Oak street station house. He answered the description given by Mary Miniter of the man who occupied the room with Mrs. Brown the night she was murdered. His clothing was the same as that given by Mary, with the exception of the trousers, which were different from those worn by the man Thursday night.It was stated in yesterday's Eagle that a policeman brought a pair of trousers that were stained with blood to the Fourth precinct police station yesterday morning, and that he spoke of having got them at a Bowery lodging house. The police refused to speak of these trousers. The fact that the mysterious prisoner answered the description of the wanted man in all particulars except as to the trousers, would indicate that after having killed the woman the murderer went to a Bowery lodging house, and finding that some of his victim's blood was on his trousers, he secured another pair, leaving the blood stained pair behind him. When Inspector Byrnes was asked about this he replied, ""Oh, he is a small thief we have wanted for a long time. I assure you he is a bum."" But he would not say who the small thief was or why a police captain and two detectives guarded him so closely and had his hands pinioned.Deputy Coroner Jenkens who made the autopsy on the body of the murdered woman, was seen by a reporter of the Eagle after he had finished his scientific examination. He said, ""I do not claim, as has been reported, that the slashing must have been done by a left handed man, or that I am sure that she was cut before she was dead. That she was strangled there is no doubt, but whether she was cut before she died from strangulation or immediately after death no one can tell. It is evident that great force was used in the clutch at her throat. The liquid condition of the blood in the heart would indicate that strangulation and not haemorrhage caused death, and yet the amount of bleeding would indicate that she was not quite dead or at least that the body was still warm when she was cut. I found one long incision from the top of the right hip bone descending obliquely across the abdomen to the pubes. The intestines protruded from this cut. It appears that after the cut was made the body was turned over and the cut was continued from the pubes upward and backward beyond the base of the backbone. There are also two long scratches in front and a perfect cross scratched in the skin at the back of the thigh.""""Was the cutting such as would have been done by a surgeon as the cutting done by Jack the Ripper of London, is said to be?"" asked the reporter. ""If it was done by a surgeon he was a butcher. It was horrible hacking.""""Would you suppose this murder was committed by the London Jack the Ripper?""""I am not advancing theories. I cannot say.""Water and Cherry streets have not witnessed so quiet a Saturday night as last night was in many years. The Fourth ward was overrun with detectives and the fallen women seemed to be more afraid of them than they did of Jack the Ripper. The dives were all open, as usual, but the women kept indoors. The East River hotel was doing a big business and the low patrons of the house indulged in coarse jokes about the awful tragedy that was enacted there two nights before.Inspector Byrnes seemed more at ease after Captain Reilly's prisoner had been brought in. His detectives were still busy rushing about the Fourth ward, but he returned to his normal condition of self confidence. The general opinion of those about police headquarters were that he had his man, but wanted to fasten the crime upon him without a doubt before he would speak of his catch.Captain O'Connor of the Oak street station strengthened the belief that the murderer, or at least the man suspected, had been arrested by announcing to the reporters shortly before midnight that they might go home, because he said: ""I assure you that no information will be given out before tomorrow afternoon."" Steve Brody seems desirous of getting all the cheap notoriety he can out of this case. He announced yesterday that he could tell who the murdered woman was, and he had a statement printed in a New York paper about her life, which proved to be untrue. Then he told reporters that his wife had found parts of the intestines in the street, near the scene of the murder, and that he had sent them to the police of the Oak street station. The police denied that they had received anything from Brody, but Deputy Coroner Jenkins admitted that the police had sent him a package and he examined the contents, which proved to be parts of the organs of a cat."

All their old clews seem to be exhausted and they now appear to be  busy looking for new ones.Inspector Byrnes denied today that he had said the man ""Frenchy"" is  the man who committed the deed. The type written statement which  Acting Inspector McLaughlin read to a number of reporters Saturday  night and which was prepared by Inspector Byrnes referred to "" Frenchy"" several times as the suspected man. Inspector Byrnes said  today that he did not want the impression to go abroad that he had  positively stated that he knew who the murderer was. ""I did not say  I knew who the man was nor that frenchy was the man,"" said the  Inspector. ""I said he was suspected of being the man. As soon as  the newspapers get through discovering the murderer I can do better  work on this case.""Inspector Byrnes also denied that a man was arrested on the  steamship Philadelphia of the Red D line last night. The watchman  at the pier states positively that a man was arrested there and  Captain O'Connor of the Oak street station admitted that such an  arrest had been made. The man was taken into custody on suspicion  of being the murderer, but was not held.The man who answered the description of the one who occupied the  room with old Shakespeare, and who was brought into police  headquarters with his hands shackled by Captain Reilly, Saturday  afternoon, seems to have mysteriously disappeared. He has not been  arraigned in any police court yet, and he is probably held at  police headquarters.Inspector Byrnes found the sister of Frenchy today and after  questioning her he sent his detectives out on a new hunt.The police of Brooklyn are still busy on the case. A drunken man  who was arrested on Meserole street answered the description of the  murderer, and early this morning Neils Hansen, a Swede, was  arrested in a Furman street boarding house on suspicion. Detective  McCauley came over with Mary Miniter to look at these prisoners.  They saw at once that neither of them was the wanted man.Detectives Conway and Noonan of the Second Brooklyn precinct made  an arrest this afternoon that may prove to be important. They have  been watching a lodging house at 125 Furman street ever since old  Shakespeare was killed. At noon a man known as Frenchy came to the  place. He was immediately placed under arrest. He does not answer  the description sent out by the New York police, but because he is  called Frenchy and says he lives at the Fourth ward hotel, the name  by which the East river hotel is generally known, he is held. He  said his name is Eli Coumanio. He is also known as John Williams.  Detectives are coming from New York to look at him."

That his  statement about Frenchy No 2 being suspected of the crime was as  was published in the EAGLE last Sunday and in all other papers more  than thirty newspaper reporters to whom it was read at different  times during Saturday night agree. Inspector Byrnes said today that  his statement of Saturday night had been so distorted that he would  say nothing more for publication at present. He had endeavored to  satisfy the public clamor for information relative to the murder of  old ""Shakespeare"", he said, but found that he was misrepresented in  all newspapers throughout the world, and therefore he would say  nothing more of what he was doing.In beginning work on his new clew the inspector put all his  available men out to search the Fourth ward. They wandered about on  the search for something and at midnight they took Mary Cody and  Kitty Lynch from a sailors' resort on Cherry street. These two  women were subjected to a long interview and after it was over that  for which the detectives seemed to be searching appeared to have  lost interest. The detectives were called in and those of them who  were not permitted to go home started out as though they had  definite destinations. Their wanderings ceased.the result of this work was the arrest of a man early this morning.  He was brought to the Oak street station house, and, after he had  been locked in a cell, the police denied that they had such a  prisoner. Acting Inspector McLaughlin was summoned and he soon  appeared at the station house. At 10 o'clock Captain O'Connor went  to the East river hotel, where he had a long talk with Landlord  Jennings. When he returned to the station house he was accompanied  by two central office detectives who had a prisoner, a rough  looking man who was very much under the influence of liquor and who  had a bloated face. It was said that there was blood under the  finger nails of the prisoner. Acting Inspector McLaughlin went back  to the cells and had a long talk with these two prisoners. Then  Captain O'Connor requested the reporters to leave the station  house, explaining that some police business was to be transacted in  private. The two girls, Kitty Lynch and Mary Cody, were sent for,  and Jennings was also brought to the station house. These three,  together with the two prisoners, were brought together in the large  sitting room, where Acting Inspector McLaughlin and several  detectives had a long talk with them all. A dispatch was then sent  to Michael Whalen, ex superintendent of the barge office, and after  he had visited the station house Detective Sergeants Mulholland and  McCluskey went out separately. They met a few blocks from the  station house and traveled together to the Battery, and from there  they went out on the bay toward the Italian passenger ship Assyria.Another search was begun in the low dives of the Fourth ward. It  resulted in Detective Griffin bringing in an old woman, a pal of  the dead victim of the man who may be Jack the Ripper. She was so  much under the influence of liquor that she could not speak. Her  arrest seemed to be the occasion of much pleasure among the police.Detectives were again summoned from police headquarters. Each of  them was instructed by Acting Inspector McLaughlin, and they then  strayed off hurriedly to execute the orders received. Mary Cody and  Kitty Lynch were permitted to depart. They walked to the East river  hotel and were greeted with a demonstration by street corner  loungers who knew them and who knew that they were arrested last  night in the Jack the Ripper case. At the hotel they were joined by  Jennings and two detectives. They were still there late this  afternoon.It is generally believed now that the police were at sea in  placing suspicion upon frenchy No. 2. He was employed in Spechman's  saloon close to the East river hotel a few days ago. Mary Minitor,  the housekeeper at the East river hotel never saw the man who  accompanied old ""Shake speare"" on the night she was murdered until  he appeared at the hotel with her that night. Frenchy No. 2 was a  regular visitor at the hotel and she knew him well. Among the women  of Water street the belief that the murder was committed by Jack  the Ripper of London, is growing stronger, and each one lives in  constant dread of being his next American victim.The police bore an air of confidence after the consultation with  Jennings and the two girls this morning. They seem to have new hope  of clearing up this case into which they have put more effort than  in any other piece of detective work on record."

It is now known that the police believe  this man, whose name is Frank Sherlie, committed the deed. The old  woman was found dead and shockingly butchered in a bed in room 31  on the top floor of the hotel. Sherlie occupied room 33 on the same  floor that night. The chemists found a trail of blood from room 31  to room 33 on the floor of the hall, and they also found evidences  of blood having been wiped off someone's hands with the dirty  bedding of this room. On a chair in room 33 they found that blood  had been deposited and then wiped off. Finally they removed the  accumulated matter from under the fingernails of Sherlich (sic) and  found that it was chiefly composed of blood. Dr. Edson of the New  York health department admitted that the above statement is  correct.Inspector Byrnes, when asked if it was true that he had this  evidence against Frenchy No. 1, refused to say whether it was or  not. He said there was nothing to say at present. He denied a  statement that had been telegraphed all over the country which made  him responsible for the above information.Frenchy No. 1 was one of the first prisoners brought in when the  police drag net was put out in the Fourth ward a week ago. He is  well known to the low women of Water street, who thoroughly fear  him because of his vicious habits. He has bitten and beaten many of  them, and he had threatened to kill the murdered woman. He is not  the man who accompanied her to the hotel the night of the murder.  The latest theory is that her companion left her soon after he went  into the room with her, and that Frenchy then slipped into her  room. She is known to have been very much under the influence of  liquor when she went upstairs, and if she was killed by Frenchy he  probably found her in a drunken sleep, which made her an easy  victim. After the arrest of Frenchy No.1 Inspector Byrnes told  reporters that he suspected a cousin of the prisoner, whom he  designated as Frenchy No. 2, to be the murderer. Two days later he  denied that he had made this statement, but he did not withdraw his  general alarm to the police of neighboring cities to arrest Frenchy  No. 2 and there have been dozens of light complexioned men with  long poses (sic) and blonde mustaches under arrest in this and  other cities. each time an arrest was made detectives traveled to  New York to where the prisoner was to say, ""That is not the man.""Yesterday Frenchy No. 2 was arrested in Jersey City, and then  Inspector Byrnes said he did not want him. He has probably looking  for more convincing evidence against the Frenchy he has and feared  that his work would be interfered with if he should admit that he  suspected his prisoner. He has maintained throughout that this  Frenchy was held as a witness and not as the murderer. Dr. Edson is  to appear as a witness at the inquest this afternoon, when it is  supposed all efforts to hide the real facts of the case will be  abandoned and that the Inspector will show the public result of his  work.Despite these statements Captain O'Connor of the Oak street station  said this morning that the murderer was still at large, but was  located and would soon be in custody. Detectives from the central  office were still busy searching the Fourth ward this morning.The body of Carrie Brown was forwarded on the 9 o'clock train this  morning. It is to be taken to Salem, Mass., to be buried by  relatives in the family plot of a cemetery in that city."

The boys had, no doubt, read the account of the Ripper's thirteenth victim, and had made up their minds to show just what they would do should that worthy appear in Brooklyn. So Saturday night they borrowed a nondescript suit of clothes and with some old paper rigged up an effigy which for fierceness and dirt went way ahead of anything that Whitechapel could produce. This effigy made its appearance first on Willoughby street, but by some medium found its way to De Kalb avenue on Sunday morning. It was hung to a convenient telegraph pole and suspended from its neck was a placard inscribed ""Jack the Ripper."" At the back was another card marked ""Inspector Byrnes."" It was in full view of the worshippers of the catholic church of Our Lady of Mercy as they came out of church. They were greeted to an exhibition of antics on the part of the boys which rivalled anything on or off the stage. About fifty of them surrounded the figure and shouted derisively.The whole neighborhood was in an uproar, the residents being convulsed with the comical aspect of the figure and the motions through which it was put.

There has been a strong suspicion entertained here and in England that Deeming is none other than the notorious Jack the Ripper, the slayer of the Whitechapel, London, outcasts and this suspicion is borne out in a measure not only by Deeming's appearance, which closely tallies with the description given of the Whitechapel fiend, but by his alleged confession. The Argus is a reliable newspaper and there is no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the statement it makes today that Deeming has acknowledged that he killed his wife and four children at Dinham villa, at Rainhill, near Liverpool, and that he murdered and mutilated the last two women whose bodies were found in the purlieus of Whitechapel.Although he has confessed that these two Whitechapel women fell victims to his mania for murder, he, while not denying, does not admit that he killed the other women whose murders at the time attracted the attention of the whole world. It is believed, however, that when he finds all hope of escape from the clutches of the law cut off he will confess not only these murders, but others of which the police knew nothing. In his confession, the Argus says, Deeming makes no mention of his object of mutilating the bodies of his Whitechapel victims and removing certain of the organs, but, it adds, there is scarcely a doubt that the man is afflicted with a disease similar in some respects to nymphomania. The case is a most peculiar one in all its aspects, and public curiosity here is excited to the highest pitch to learn all the details of Deeming's many crimes.It is said that Deeming made his confession to an official at Perth, West Australia, where he was arrested on the charge of having murdered his wife at Windsor, a suburb of Melbourne. Deeming secured counsel and made a strong fight against being sent back to Melbourne, but the court ordered his surrender to the authorities of this city and yesterday he started in custody of officers on his return. He told the Perth official to whom he made his confession that he was not guilty of the Windsor murder. His wife, he claimed, had eloped with another man.It has transpired that the unfortunate woman whose body was found, together with those of her four children, under the floor of the Rainhill residence was not Deeming's first wife. Some years ago a sensation was created in Australia by the mysterious disappearance of the wife and two children of a man who then went by the name of Williams but who turns out to be Deeming. The family then resided in Sydney. There was grave suspicion of foul play at the time but the bodies were not found, and, this essential proof of murder being lacking, the matter was allowed to drop. Deeming subsequently went to Eng land and then it was he married the woman whose murder he is now said to have confessed."

He was a robber, swindler and a murderer  of women and helpless children. The record of his crimes for the  last ten years is startling. It begins with a petty theft, for  which he served a sentence of six weeks, and ends with the murder  of his young bride and the preparations for the killing of a girl  whom he was about to marry. Here are some of the things that he  did: After the theft he went in business in Sidney (sic),  Australia, and made a fraudulent assignment, swindling his  creditors out of a large sum; he swindled two brothers out of £60  and fled to Cape Town; obtained £4,000 on the strength of bogus  deeds for South African property and went to England; obtained  jewelry at Hull under false pretences; escaped to South America,  but was caught and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment; rented a  villa in the suburbs of Liverpool, and took to it the wife he  married in 1881, with her four children, and murdered them and  buried the bodies beneath the hearthstone; soon after he married  Miss Emily Mather, a Liverpool girl, and took her to Australia,  where he killed her also and buried her under the floor of his  house. On the eve of his marriage to Miss Kate Rouncesvell at  Perth, West Australia, he was arrested for his last crime. This was  in March. As soon as the prosecuting officers in Melbourne had  obtained the evidence necessary to convict him he was brought to  trial and found guilty. He declared himself innocent of any wrong  doing and made an appeal. There was no delay, for the English law,  which applies to the mother country as well as the colonies,  requires that a sentence of death must be executed within twenty  one days from the time that it is pronounced.The Victorian Executive and the British privy council refused to  interfere and the man went to his death. Before the execution he  confessed that the had murdered Miss Mather, the last woman whom he  had married, but he said that he was not guilty of the other crimes  with which he was charged. He wrote the story of this life while in  the Melbourne jail and bequeathed to Miss Rouncesvell one tenth of  the profits from its publication.All the atrocious and mysterious crimes committed in England,  Australia and Southern Africa during the last few years have been  ascribed to Deeming since his arrest. This was but natural, for the  police need some excuse for their inefficiency and the public makes  a hero of every great criminal. Yet it is not improbable that he  was guilty of many undetected murders. One theory is that he was  Jack the Ripper which filled the Whitechapel district of London with  terror. There is no doubt that he was capable of Jack the Ripper's  butchery, for a man who did not hesitate to slay his wife and his  own small children would not hesitate when the life of an outcast  was in question. He seems to have been possessed of a thirst for  the blood of women. None of his victims were men. Until the  Whitechapel outlaw is arrested there will be people who believe  that they have found in him ever brutal murderer. It is a fact to  be regretted, however, that savage passion is not confined to the  breast of one man who has frequented the slums of London  inetrmittently for the last four years. It is in every heart  awaiting favorable conditions for its development. What those  conditions were in the case of Deeming has not yet been disclosed."

Theodore Swain, a Memphis minister, now a guest of the Laclode. ""I was wandering about the city sight seeing on day, and finally found myself near the notorious Whitechapel district. I was approached by a beggar who appeared to be a complete physical wreck. I questioned him, and his story was so pitiful that I concluded to investigate it. He said that he lodged in the next block, and thither we went. He led me into a gloomy old building and up three pairs of rickety stairs to a little stuffy room, lit only by a dirty skylight. Once in there he locked the door, laid aside his crutches, pulled off his gray wig and stood up a powerful six footer in the prime of life. ""Well,"" said I, ""I see that you are a fraud; what do you want with me?"" He replied that he wanted my purse, watch and chain, and to enforce his claim produced an ugly looking knife. ""It will do you no good to cry out,"" he said, ""for you cannot be heard in the street, and no one in this building will come to your aid."" I had sized him up pretty close and concluded that he was bluffing - that he would not dare kill me in the very heart of London, so I assumed a careless air and told him that if he robbed me he would have to kill me first, and that he might just as well get at it. ""Oh, I know that you have a pistol, but I'm not afraid of it,"" he said. ""Most Americans carry pistols for just such cattle as you,"" I replied, with all the coolness I could assume. ""Now, if you are not afraid of it, why don't you get to work?"" I saw that he was cowed, and, throwing my hand to my hip pocket, I steeped forward and said firmly, ""Give me that knife."" He handed it to me without a word, unlocked the door and held it open for me to pass out. No, I had no pistol - never carry one - but I made no more visits to the dens of London beggars without a burly officer at my elbow."""

It is part of the history of that remarkable series of atrocious murders committed in the Whitechapel district of London, in the autumn of 1888, by a man who is known indefinitely in criminal annals as Jack the Ripper. His fourth victim was a widow named Mary Ann Chapman. Her mutilated body was found at daylight in the yard of a house in Hanbury street. On the shutter of the adjoining dwelling there was found scribbled with chalk the following message from the mysterious assassin: ""I have murdered four, and will murder sixteen more before I surrender myself to the police."" Sir Charles Warren, who was in charge of the Scotland Yard detective force, caused the prophecy to be erased, and was subsequently severely criticized for having done so without securing a photographic reproduction of the murderer's handwriting. This murder was committed on September 8. On the following October 1, between the hours of 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, Jack the Ripper had left behind him the mutilated bodies of two more of Whitechapel's unfortunate women. Both crimes were absolutely appalling in the boldness of their execution. One was committed in the yard of a club house while its members were indulging in a weekly discussion. The victim in this case was recognized by her sister, the wife of a tailor, as one Eliza Watts. The tailor's wife was positive in her identification and called special attention to the mark of an adder's bite on one of the murdered woman's legs. She stated that at the very hour of the murder she had a presentiment that something was wrong. At 12.40 o'clock in the morning, she claimed, both she and her husband felt something fall on the bed they occupied. Then she felt three kisses upon her face. She immediately became fearful that evil had befallen her sister, and at once went to the morgue, where her worst fears were realized, and she found her sister's dead body. The identification was made absolutely without reservation, and was supported by the testimony of others. yet at the final session of the coroner's inquest Eliza Watts walked into the hearing room and openly denounced her sister for having maligned her character and for having dared to suggest that she was dead. The corpse was subsequently identified as that of a notorious woman known as Elizabeth Stride.This instance of the fallibility of human identification sends our thoughts drifting away from the Luetgert case to the historically atrocious crimes of Jack the Ripper. Only the other day a newspaper was published suggesting that a criminal who had been arrested for some fiendish murder in Paris was possibly the mysterious assassin of the Whitechapel district. Among men well informed in criminal affairs it was supposed that the identity of that incarnate fiend was settled some time ago. A well known London physician, Dr. Howard, gave to the world a guarded statement in which he declared by seeming authority that the mysterious murderer was a demented physician afflicted with wildly uncontrollable erotic mania, and that he had been confined in a private asylum for the insane. At the time of this declaration and commenting upon it, the St. Louis Globe Democrat stated openly that it unsealed the lips of a Chicago man who gave a remarkable account of the manner in which the identity of the Whitechapel murderer was fixed beyond the shadow of a doubt. The Dr. Howard referred to was one of a dozen London physicians who sat as a commission in lunacy upon their brother physician, for at last it was definitely proved that the dread Jack the Ripper was a physician in high standing and enjoying the patronage of the best society in the West End of London. When it was proven that he was the murderer and his identity fully established, all persons having knowledge of the facts were sworn to secrecy. Up to the time of Dr. Howard's disclosure this oath had been rigidly adhered to. Robert James Lees, who tracked down the Ripper, developed in early life extraordinary clairvoyant powers. He was the recognized leader of the Christian Spiritualists of Great Britain. While London was shuddering over the third murder Mr. Lees became convinced one day that another tragedy was about to be enacted. He seemed to see a man and woman enter a narrow court. The clock showed the time to be 40 minutes past 12. The man was drunk. He wore a dark suit and carried a light overcoat. In a dark corner of the court he cut the woman's throat and mutilated her lower limbs with a long knife. Then he wiped his knife on the woman's dress, buttoned up his light overcoat to conceal blood stains on his shirt and calmly walked away. Mr. Lees told his vision to a Scotland Yard sergeant, who thought he was a lunatic, but noted the main points of his story. The next night a woman was found murdered and mutilated at the hour and place seen by Mr. Lees. A man carrying a light overcoat had been seen with the woman.One day while riding with his wife in an omnibus Mr. Lees felt a renewal of the strange sensations which preceded his former clairvoyant condition. The omnibus stopped and a man wearing a light overcoat got in. His face was that of the murderer seen by Mr. Lees in his vision. To his wife he said, ""This is Jack the Ripper."" The man alighted in Oxford street. Mrs. Lees continued her journey, but her husband followed the man down Park lane. He must have feared danger, for he jumped into a cab and was driven rapidly away. That night Mr. Lees received premonitions that another murder was about to be committed. The face of the murdered woman was clearly defined, and one ear was severed, while the other hung by a shred. Mr. Lees hastened to Scotland Yard and told his story to the head inspector. Trembling and pale that officer showed him a postal card bearing the marks of two bloody fingers and reading as follows:""Tomorrow night I shall again take my revenge, claiming my ninth victim. To prove that I am really Jack the Ripper, I will cut off the ears of this ninth victim.""By dark the next day 3,000 constables in plain clothes and 1,500 detectives disguised as workingmen were patrolling the courts and alleys of Whitechapel, but Jack the Ripper penetrated the cordon, slew and mutilated his victim, as foretold by Mr. Lees and escaped. Soon afterward Mr. Lees and two Americans were driving one day when Mr. Lees suddenly exclaimed: ""The Ripper has committed another murder."" It was then eleven minutes to 8. Ten minutes after 8 the body of another victim was found in the Whitechapel district. Mr. Lees and his companions hurried to Scotland Yard. A few minutes later a telegram arrived detailing a fresh murder. With the inspectors and two officers Mr. Lees and his friends hastened to the scene of the tragedy. Mr. Lees felt a subtle power connecting himself with the fleeing Ripper. All that night the clairvoyant traversed swiftly the streets of London. The inspector and his aids followed close behind. At 4 o'clock in the morning Mr. Lees stopped before a West End mansion, and, pointing to a light in an upper chamber, exclaimed: ""There is the murderer."" The inspector hesitated to enter, and asked Mr. Lees to describe the interior of the hall. He did so. At 7 o'clock they entered and found the hall as described. The doctor was dumbfounded. He said he had had intervals when all that happened was a blank to him, and expressed horrors at the murders. After the examination referred to above, the Ripper was removed to a private asylum, and by agreement he was reported dead. At the asylum the Ripper, who is now a ferocious maniac, is simply known as Thomas Mason, or No. 124. Is that all true? I don't know. Things have happened equally as strange. The story is vouched for on high authority.Philadelphia Times."

He had heard of the murders, and his first conclusion was that the man who committed them is undoubtedly crazy.""Either he has been deceived by a woman,"" said Williamson, ""or he has received by association with them some deep physical  injury. He is probably one of the higher class of people, perhaps a medical student. He is not of the Whitechapel folks, but  must be looked for outside.""Charles A Clark, a forger with a sentence of four years and eight months, was a very intelligent Englishman, and almost had a  map of Whitechapel in his head. He spoke of the favorable nature of that district, with its countless courts and alleys, for  the commission and concealment of crimes like these.""If the murderer is caught I am inclined to think it will be by accident,"" said Clark.THINKS HE IS A MEDICAL STUDENTGeorge Edwards, also an Englishman and a forger, said the murderer was undoubtedly a crank. Probably he had been a medical  student, as his work was done so skilfully, and he had allowed his studied to lead him the wrong way. He was probably  affected by association with the class of women whom he now seeks to remove. Edwards did not believe the murderer would stop  when he got fifteen victims. He would probably keep right on. Such a series of crimes would hardly be possible under the  American detective system, but were undoubtedly aided in London by the nature of the locality.""An officer in woman's clothing might be able to do something,"" suggested Edwards, ""if he could play his part well.""John Dean is a ruggedly built fellow serving out a twenty years' term for manslaughter. He is an Englishman and has been a  sailor.""My first thought about these murders,"" said he, ""was that they might have been the work of a revengeful Malay sailor who had  been cheated by one of these women and took short voyages between the crimes to elude suspicion. The objection to that  conclusion is that some of the other women would have known of the cheating and would not have kept still about it. But the  final conclusion that I have been forced to is that the murderer, from some cause, is a maniac on that subject - a fanatic.  It is easy enough for him to elude the police in that locality; even if he were covered with blood, it would be nothing  unusual, for there are slaughter houses near, and I myself have seen a man with a bloody knife held in his mouth run out to  get a pail of beer and then hurry back.""Steve Raymond is an Englishman, too. He is in Sing Sing for life, and is the only convict serving such a term as that for  forgery. He comes under the amended habitual criminals law. Raymond believed the murderer to be a high class, well educated man, very cunning and crazy on that one point. He did not  think the man accosted Whitechapel women, but that he sauntered through that locality and let himself be led; then when a  suitable place was reached he would seize his victim after the fashion of the garroter, pull his knife quickly as the woman  became limp and then complete his work.""He carries, I think,"" said Raymond, ""some little articles of disguise, perhaps an alpaca coat and gloves, which can be  folded up small and put on very quickly.""All considered that the man comes from the higher class of people, and, being most extraordinary in his character and deeds,  will require most extraordinary means for his capture.At the New Jersey state prison the following opinions were obtained:Libbie Garrabandt, who, when a young woman, poisoned her old husband to accept the love of a younger man, and who has in  consequence spent the best years of her life in prison, did not seem disposed to discuss the Whitechapel murders. She said it  made her shudder to hear of such horrible crimes. She believed that no one but a lunatic could be the guilty man.AN EX POLICEMAN'S VIEWJohn Nugent, formerly a New York policeman and who is supposed to have been concerned in the well remembered Manhattan bank  robbery, but who is serving a term here for a different offense, knew more of the London murders than any of the other  convicts.This is accounted for by the fact that Nugent is one of the clerks of the prison library, and, therefore, has more facility  for learning the news of the outside world.""I doubt very much,"" said he, ""whether it is the one man that is committing all these murders. I don't believe one man could  follow it up for so long and not be discovered. I think there is a band of them, who for some devilish purpose of their own  have pledged themselves to each slay on or two of these women of the street.""Either that, or else several men of fiendish souls are acting independently of each other and unknown to each other, one  having taken inspiration from the deed of another.""Some of the other convicts expressed themselves with brevity, and a number had nothing to say. Here are some of the  expressions:By a man who himself narrowly escaped the Gallows: If there is one or a dozen of them they ought to be strung up as soon as  found. They don't need any trial.By a Hudson County man doing time for assault: It looks like the kind of murders a woman would commit rather than a man.By a burglar: If they had the same kind of police in Newark I wouldn't be in prison now.By a Camden barn burner: If it's one man doing all these murders, he's crazy as Guiteau was; but that kind of craziness ought  to be punished with hanging every time."

TUMBLETYThe Notorious Whitechapel Suspect and His Ways and MannersTumblety has tumbled to himself, and the detectives are ""onto him"" in America.But he isn't Jack the Ripper, the Whitechapel murderer, by a long tumble.Neither is he the accomplice of Dr. Blackburn, who was accused of a conspiracy to introduce yellow fever into northern cities; nor is he an accomplice of Wilkes Booth, or of Guiteau, though he has been accused of all these and many other bad things. The very curious fact about Tumblety is that he is two totally different men; that is, he has lived two totally distinct lives, and there are two irreconcilable histories given of him, each by witnesses who are positive they are correct.This much, however, is certain, that he has sought notoriety persistently in many parts of the United States and in England, and has finally got altogether too much of it and of a kind that he does not enjoy; so he now seeks solitude as earnestly as he once sought publicity. Two or three times in his life he has had plenty of money, and enjoyed spending it; but he has outlived that, and since his arrest by the London police and escape by forfeiting his bail he has lived as retired and economically as police surveillance would allow. His real history is coming out by fragments here and there, but as to his origin there are two accounts; one makes him the son of a poor laborer, born in Canada and reared in Rochester, N.Y., with very little education; the other, which is direct from one of his former intimates, makes him the son of a wealthy Irish gentleman from Dublin and a well educated physician.In 1866 he was a ""herb doctor"" in Cincinnati and made lots of money, though he privately confessed that all his pills, powders and tonics were made of tanbark. He cured everything, from tetter and pimples to cross eyes and Bright's disease, and had many certificates of his success. He attended high mass at the cathedral, and was preceded to the service by a colored page in gorgeous livery, carrying a big prayer book in a velvet covered stand. This scandalized the worshippers and the ""doctor"" was requested to worship less ostentatiously or go elsewhere.He spent the early years of the war in Brooklyn, where his odd dress and the immense dog which accompanied him on the streets attracted much attention. His intimate companion was young Harold, the same who was with Wilkes Booth after the assassination of President Lincoln and was hanged for it. Several years later he was an associate in New York of Charles J. Guiteau, who murdered President Garfield. At the close of the war he was arrested on a charge of complicity with an attempt to introduce yellow fever into New York, and he still claims that the authorities robbed him of several thousand dollars in United States bonds.He calls himself ""Doctor Francis Tumblety,"" and though the oddity of the name suggests that it is assumed, he has been called by it ever since he was first known in America, though the Rochester witnesses think it was there spelled Twombletey (sic). His ""herb doctoring"" finally became unprofitable in America; so he went to London, located near the Whitechapel road and for a while did a big business. His oddity of manner, dress and speech soon made him notorious as the ""American doctor""; but he enjoyed notoriety and turned it into money, till the Whitechapel horrors caused a general overhauling of suspicious characters.He talked a great deal about the butcheries, dropped mysterious hints and was arrested - probably what he wanted - but it proved unprofitable, for the London courts made it very expensive for him and put him under bail of $1,500 as a fraud and suspicious character. He forfeited his bail, fled to France, and early in December came to New York, travelling very light in the matter of baggage. He is a very tall, dark, queer looking man, with a regular hussar mustache, and certainly has had rare luck in acquiring notoriety."

Another  parcel, in which were a woman's thighs, was picked up at Battersea. Both were wrapped in pieces of a woman's drawers, on  which the name Fisher was marked. The trunk and thighs evidently belonged to the same, which was of a well developed person.  The remains had probably been in the water for ten days. It is feared that Jack the Ripper has again been at work.The condition of the remains found at Horsley Down shows clearly that the woman had recently given birth to a child. It is  believed that she was the victim of malpractice, and that the persons connected with the operation cut the body up in order  to escape discovery. The doctors have examined the remains and declare that they could not have been in the water over twenty  four hours. They think the woman was about 25 years of age."

In all there have now been found twelve bodies of murdered women and  there is no clew to the slayer. Nine of the twelve bodies were found in Whitechapel. The women belong to the lowest outcast  class. To one of the corpses a note was pinned saying that the murderer would desist when he had killed fifteen women.Of the ghastly twelve bodies right were disembowelled and mutilated in a peculiar manner, all the same way. The unknown  person who committed these crimes is nicknamed Jack the Ripper. The four other dead women found in Whitechapel were killed by  another hand, it is believed, since they were mutilated in a different manner, the heads and limbs being cut off and only the  trunk left. It is simply inexplicable that in one of the most thickly populated districts of London, lighted all night and  patrolled by police, with a detective force supposed to be equal to any in the world, the heads of four murdered women could  be cut off and carried away and successfully concealed.The whole case reminds one of Poe's story of the mysterious Paris murders. The Whitechapel killings began April 9, 1888, and  have been shocking civilization at intervals ever since. One supposition is that the original Ripper is a ferocious lunatic  with some fancied grudge at the unfortunate class of women named. But his work is too systematic and long continued for that.  A horrible circumstance attending this series of crimes is that other wretches the world over read of it and attempt to  imitate it. There seems a contagion about it."

Second she is, not a man but a woman, who gathers her splashed and bloody skirt around her waist under her shawl immediately after the deed is done, and so escapes detection. Then, since women are ""always at the washtub"" she easily washes out the stains and is not detected. Third, the murderer is some one employed in a slaughter house, and familiar with the way in which animals are slaughtered in London. The Whitechapel victims have had their throats cut from behind, and have then been eviscerated in the exact manner in which a London butcher begins to dress a sheep. The cuts are long and slashing, unlike those made either by a surgeon or a novice. There are known to be women employed occasionally about the London butcher shops. It is here, according to Dr. Tait, that detectives should search for a true clew.  "

Fox, the celebrated wigmaker of Covent garden, has recently explained that he is constantly in the habit of  disguising persons for purposes quite unknown to him. Being of opinion that a few more details about his ""unholy art"" would  not be without interest, we dispatched a representative to see Mr. Fox, who went to business at once:""You would be astonished,"" he began, ""to know the number of people who come here to be disguised. It has grown into a part of  our regular business. Men of all classes come - gentlemen, detectives, amateur detectives, and I do not doubt that I have  disguised on many occasions some of the greatest criminals of the day. Of course it is none of my business to inquire into  the purposes for which these disguises are assumed, though sometimes I am told. The people who come generally have some tale  to tell on the first occasion, but I take these tales with a grain or two of salt. A large number of private detectives and  even Scotland Yard men come to me, and as I know their business I ask no questions. That they disguise themselves is  perfectly legitimate. However, as I was saying, sometimes I am told afterward what the disguise was wanted for.MANNER OF DISGUISING""Why, I have a customer at the present time who comes in sometimes two or three times a week. He is made up as a middle aged  man and goes out of the shop so completely disguised that none of his friends know him. I don't know what his object is. He  seldom stays away more than two or three hours, then comes back, resumes his natural dress and appearance and I hear no more  of him till he comes again to be disguised. I fancy it is a case of 'cherchez la femme' but, of course, it is no business of  mine.""""Do you ever have ladies to disguise?""""No. In fact, I think I may say never. You see the art of making up comes natural to almost all women. I think it is born in  them. They all understand how to beautify themselves. And if they want to disguise themselves they prefer to trust to their  own ingenuity. A change of dress, a veil, an alteration in the mode of doing the hair, a pair of spectacles and there you  are; detection is almost impossible.""""Now, Mr. Fox, how do you set about disguising a person?""""Oh, it is very easy. We change the expression of the face by deepening shadows, alter the shape of the eyebrows by touching  with a trifle of color, put a little hair on with spirit gum, change the fashion of the hair on the head, and sometimes throw  into prominence the bones and muscles of the neck. Making up for the street is totally different from making up for the  stage. For daylight use we must employ as little paint as possible. A piece of burnt paper produces a lovely and most  delicate color which we use for deepening shadows, and it is imperceptible to the naked eye of the ordinary observer.""I can produce the appearance of a chin which has not been shaved for three or four days in a very simple manner. The face is  first toned to the required shade; then covered with a thin layer of spirit gum; then a quantity of finely chopped hair is  then dabbed on to the chin and cheeks when the gum is nearly dry. Of course the things to be avoided are to leave the gum  shiny and to have the hair dabbed on in patches. Practice makes perfect and an adept hand never makes these blunders.MINOR POINTS OF THE ART""Crepe hair may be used for whiskers or beard in an absolutely undetectable manner if carefully put on and trimmed afterward.  But I prefer, instead of using wigs or false hair, to alter the dressing of a man's own hirsute appendages. Thus, indeed, by  showing your upper lip. just altering the set of your eyebrows a little and by deepening the shadows on your face and neck a  little you would find your face completely altered. But there is one important thing in effecting a disguise which you must  not forget. It is not alone the head and the face which must be altered. The attire, the dress, must undergo just as complete  a change. A turned down collar, a different suit of clothes, boots and hat, and even the pocket handkerchief needs to be  different from that you usually carry. Why, do you know that the very manner of carrying a handkerchief in the pocket has  been sufficient before now to detect a person through a clever disguise?""""How long does it take you to effect one of your startling disguises?""""From ten minutes to half an hour, according to the character to be assumed and the amount of work required. This also  regulates the cost, which is from half a guinea upward. In ten minutes, for half a guinea, I will disguise you so completely  that neither your own mother, your wife nor the editor of your paper would know you. As I have said, I prefer not to use wigs  - of course their use increases the cost - and I always demand a deposit if I loan them. Yes, sometimes I get suspicious  characters; then I notify Bow Street.""During the Jack the Ripper scare I must have had hundreds of customers. At last it got such a big thing, and I took such an  interest in the affair, I sent across to Bow Street, and several of my customers were shadowed. One was followed to Mentone  and another to New York. They all professed to be amateur detectives, but I fancy some were anything but that, and I even  dare to say that the gentleman himself may have passed through my hands more than once. It is quite a common thing for large  publicans, who own a number of houses, to disguise themselves and visit their various places to watch and see if there is any  shady business going on with their responsible representatives, but I think the majority of my customers are jealous husbands  who think it necessary to keep a sharp eye on their wives."""

All of the victims were apparently seized from behind and had their throats cut. Four of the five women were mutilated.The murderer was never found.To link the Duke of larence, brother of King George V and heir to the throne of England, with the Whitechapel killer seems to me to be utterly preposterous.The man behind the Duke of Clarence theory was the brain surgeon Dr. Thomas E. Stowell. In a recent article published in The Criminologist before his recent death, Dr. Stowell hints that Jack the Ripper had royal blood.The story put forward contends:That Prince Eddy,as he was popularly known, contracted syphilis as a young man, and the disease affected his brain and that on numerous occasions he managed to shake off Sir William Gull, the royal physician appointed as his watchdog, and prowl the streets of Whitechapel.That he was a keen sportsman with skill in dissecting deer. (This would explain the Ripper's expertise in carving up prostitutes.)That the Whitechapel murders ceased because Prince Eddy was confined to a mental home.That the police, as soon as they learned the royal birth of the killer, concealed his identity and destroyed incriminating evidence.After two years of research into the Jack the Ripper crimes, I decided that the Duke of Clarence theory was too far fetched even to metir mention in the book I wrote on the subject.In the 80 odd years that have elapsed since the Whitechapel murders, Jack the Ripper has been ""identified"" countless times, as an unfrocked priest, a sadistic policeman and an escaped gorilla, to name a few of the theoretical killer.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, was not alone in believing the killer to be a ""Jill the Ripper,"" a woman, or a man disguised as a woman.The Duke of Clarence has been singled out for notoriety because the British love to project all sorts of fantasies onto members of the royalty who are known to be soft in the head.That Prince Eddy, who was sometimes called ""Collars and Cuffs,"" was not quite bright is beyond doubt. The prince was barely 16 when his tutor, the Reverend Dalton, reported to the royal parents on Eddy's ""weakness of brain, his feebleness and lack of power to grasp almost anything put before him.""Despite the fact that he could barely read, the prince was sent to Cambridge University, where he was given the honorary degree of Doctor of Law.As for the ""case"" that the Duke of Clarence and Jack the Ripper were the same person, there is no evidence of syphilis affecting Eddy's already dim wits. Nor would it be an easy matter to persuade British police to conceal the identity of a murderer, no matter how highly born.Far from being confined to a mental home after the last of the Ripper murders in 1888, Prince Eddy continued to lead an active life. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in his father's regiment, the 10th Hussars, and was engaged to Princess May of Teck in December 1891. A month later, he died at Sandringham of influenza that had turned into pneumonia.My research into the identity of Jack the Ripper led me to conclude that the Ripper was a barrister named Montague John Druitt, who came from a well known Dorset family.Druitt committed suicide by drowning himself in the Thames late in November 1888. No murders of the Ripper type occurred after that date and the police, after the suicide had been discovered, called off the search for the Ripper. From my own inquiries, I have no doubt that Druitt's own family suspected him of being the Whitechapel murderer."

225,index/bush_advocate_18881117.txt,bush_advocate,1888-11-17,"The Bush AdvocateNew Zealand17 November 1888THE WHITECHAPEL TRAGEDIESSTARTLING REVELATIONS(Home Paper)Mr. Wynne Baxter on Wednesday resumed the inquest at Whitechapel on the body of Annie Chapman, who was  murdered on 8th. inst. in the backyard of 29 Hanbury Street. The Coroner at one proceeded to sum up the  evidence. He recalled the important facts of the case. It was in a Spitalfields lodging house that the  deceased received the older bruises found on her temple and front of the chest, in a trumpery quarrel a  week before her death. It was in one of these lodging houses that she was seen a few hours before her  mangled remains were discovered. She was found dead about six o'clock. All was done with reckless  daring. The murder seemed, like the Bucks Row case, to have been carried out without any cry. Sixteen  people were in the house. The partitions of the rooms were of wood. The brute who committed the offence  did not even take the trouble to cover up his ghastly work, but left the body expose to view. Probably  as daylight broke he hurried away in fear. The Coroner then proceeded to observe - There are two things  missing - her ring had been wrenched from her finger, and had not been found, and an organ had been  taken away. The body had not been dissected, but the injuries had been made by some one with  considerable anatomical knowledge and skill. There are no meaningless cuts. The organ has been taken  away by one who knew where to find it, what difficulties he would have to contend against, and how he  should use his knife so as to abstract the organ without injury to it any surgeon knows. No unskilled  person could have known where to find it, or have recognised it when it was found. For instance, no  mere slaughterer of animals could have carried out these operations. It must have been some one  accustomed to the post mortem room. The conclusion that the desire was to possess the missing organ  seems overwhelming. If the object were robbery injuries to the viscera were meaningless, for death had  previously resulted from loss of blood at the neck. The difficulty in believing that the purpose of the  murderer was possession of the organ is natural. It is abhorrent to our feelings to conclude that a  life should be taken for so slight an object, but when rightly considered the reasons for most murders  are altogether out of proportion to the guilt. It has been suggested that the criminal is a lunatic with  morbid feelings. This may or may not be the case, but the object of the murderer appears palpably shown  by the facts, and it is not necessary to assume lunacy, for it is clear that there is a market for the  missing organ. To show you this I must mention a fact, which at the same time proves the assistance  which publicity and the newspaper press affords in the detection of crime. Within a few hours of the  issue of the morning papers containing the report of the medical evidence given at the last sitting of  the Court I received a communication from an officer of one of our great medical schools that they had  information that might or might not have a distinct bearing upon our inquiry. I attended at the first  opportunity, and was informed by the sub-curator of the Pathological Museum that some months ago an  American had called on him and asked him to procure a number of specimens of the organ that was missing  in the deceased. He stated his willingness to give twenty pounds for each specimen, and said his object  was to issue an actual specimen with each copy of a publication on which he was then engaged. He was  told that his request was impossible to be complied with, but still he urged his request. He wished  them preserved, not in spirits of wine, the usual medium, but in glycerine in order to preserve them in  a flaccid condition, and he wished them sent to America direct. It is known that this request was  repeated to another institution of a similar character. Now, is it not possible the knowledge of this  demand incited some abandoned wretch to possess himself of a specimen. Our criminal annals prove that  every crime is possible. I at once communicated my information to Scotland Yard. I do not know what use  has been made of it, but I believe that publicity may further elucidate this fact; and therefore I have  not withheld from you the information. By means of the press some further explanation may be  forthcoming from America, if not from here. I have endeavoured to suggest to you the object with which  the crime was committed, and the class of person who committed it. The greatest deterrent from crime is  the conviction that detection and punishment will follow with rapidity and certainty, and it may be  that the impunity with which Mary Anne Smith and Anne Tabram (sic) were murdered suggested the  possibility of such horrid crimes as those with which you and another jury have recently been  considering. It is therefore a great misfortune that nearly three weeks have elapsed without the chief  actor in this awful tragedy having been discovered. It is not as if there were no clue to the character  of the criminal, or the cause of his crime. His object is clearly divulged. His anatomical knowledge  carries him out of the category of a common criminal, for that knowledge could only have been obtained  by assisting at post mortems, or by frequenting the post mortem room. Thus the class in which search  must be made, although a large one, is limited. Moreover, it must be a man who was from home, if not  all night, at least during the early hours of 8th September. His hands were undoubtedly bloodstained,  for he did not stop to use the tap in the yard, as the pan of clean water under it shows. If the theory  of lunacy be correct - which I very much doubt - the class is still further limited, while if Mrs.  Long's memory does not fail, and the assumption be correct that the man who was talking to deceased at  half past five was the culprit, he is even more clearly defined. he was a foreigner of dark complexion,  over 40 years of age, a little taller than deceased, of shabby genteel appearance, with brown  deerstalker  hat on his head and a dark coat on his back. We are confronted with a murder of no  ordinary character, committed not for jealousy, revenge, or robbery, but for a motive less adequate  than the many which still disgrace our civilisation, mar our progress, and blot the pages of our  Christianity.The jury immediately returned a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown."

For months women of the lowest class of ""unfortunates"" were found murdered and  mutilated in a shocking manner. In the poorest districts of the city a ""reign of terror"" prevailed. The  police seemed powerless to afford any help or protection, and, in spite of all their watchfulness,  fresh cases were from time to time reported, all the victims belonging to the same class, and all  having been mutilated in the same fiendish way. At last a girl one night was accosted in the street by  a workman, who asked her to take a walk with him. When, by the light of the lamp, she saw his face, it  inspired her with a strange feeling of fear and aversion; and it instantly flashed upon her that he  must be the murderer. She therefore gave him in charge to the police, who, on inquiry, found that her  woman's instinct had accomplished what had baffled the skill and the exertions of all their detectives.  The long sought criminal had at last been found. It subsequently came to light that he had been impelled  to commit these crimes by a brutal form of homicidal monomania. He had sense enough to know that from  this class of women being out late at night, and being friendless and unprotected, he could indulge his  horrible craze on them with comparative safety and impunity, and he therefore avoided selecting his  victims from a more respectable class. He was convicted and executed, to the great relief of the  public; and if any persons were afterwards tempted to imitate him, his prompt punishment effectually  deterred them. This notorious case must be well known to the  Parisian police, and to thousands of  persons in France, and if inquiry is made its history can be easily procured."""

The two victims as in  former cases were dissolute women of the poorest class. The first murder occurred in a narrow court off  Berners street at an early hour this morning, beneath the window of a foreign socialist club. A concert  was in progress and many members of the club were present, but no sound was heard from the victim. The  woman had been seized by the throat and her cries choked while the murderer with one sweeping cut  severed her throat from ear to ear. The other murder was committed three quarters of an hour later in  Mitre square. A policeman patrols the square every ten minutes. The body of the unfortunate woman had  been disembowelled, her throat cut, and her nose severed.

The police have made no progress in their efforts to establish a clue to the murderer and have lost  public confidence in their  efficiency by that fact that the person arrested on suspicion of connection  with the tragedy were (sic) released to-day for want of even a scintilla of evidence upon which to  justify their retention in custody. They profess to be hopeful of success, however, and many people are  inclined to hope with them in the absence of any suspicion in their own minds, even remotely defined as  to the criminal's motive, calling (or) identity. The private rewards offered for his arrest, added to  that of the Lord Mayor, bring the total sum up to £1,200 and it is likely that it will soon reach £2, 000. The Stock Exchange is discussing the question of starting a fund, to defray the expenses of the  murderers detection and to reward his captors. The fact that the latest murder was committed within the  jurisdiction of the city police has created a sharp rivalry between that body and General Warren's  metropolitan detectives. Many wagers have been laid upon the question of the murderer's capture with  the odds largely in favor of the city police solving the mystery and landing the fiend in jail. It is  now proposed to send a circular to every householder in the East End requesting details of the  movements and habits of their respective lodgers. The theory has largely obtained support t-day that  the murderer has two domiciles, one probably a shop or a surgery to which he retires for the purpose of  removing the traces of his crimes and the other a dwelling house where he is only known as a lodger  whose habits and manners make him a desirable boarder in the estimation of his landlady. The police are  being urged to station bloodhounds in the Whitechapel district in the hope that they may be able by  their keenness of scent to run this fiend down when he seeks a fresh victim.

The body is that of a woman about 30 years of age and well clad. Her linen was marked. Her throat had been cut and her skull fractured, and all of the pockets in her clothing were empty. A perambulator containing a blood stained fur rug was found nearby, which, it is supposed, was used to convey the body from the spot where the crime was committed to where it was found.The body has been identified as that of Mrs. Hobbs, the wife of a porter employed in London. Mrs. Hobbs left her husband on the day she disappeared, taking with her child, whom she carried in the perambulator which was found near the place where the body was discovered. The whereabouts of the child is a mystery. The murderer stole from the victim a gold ring and a purse. The child which Mrs. Hobbs had with her was 18 months old.

Windows were smashed and a bloody carving knife, and a bent poker, smeared with blood, to which adhered several locks of woman's hair, were found.

The police now have in their possession a sharp, dangerous looking knife, stained with blood and showing traces of having recently been washed. The blood stains were examined microscopically by Dr. Phillips, the police surgeon attached to the Leman street police station. Dr. Phillips had no doubt that the stains are those of human blood. This formidable knife has been traced to the possession of Sadler, who, as already stated, was a fireman on board the steamer which recently arrived from Turkey. That police have no doubt that Sadler was the murderer of Carroty Nell.From the time that it became known that Sadler had been arrested and was formally charged with the murder of Carroty Nell the greatest excitement has prevailed in and about Whitechapel. The Stepney police station, where the prisoner was detained, is surrounded by a vast crowd of people, mostly women. The women are eager for a sight of the prisoner, Wild threats of lynching and tearing the prisoner to pieces was uttered by the most excited of these females. When the man was removed to the police court an immense force of police was necessary in order to prevent the Whitechapel mob from lynching the bloodstained prisoner. Opinions differ as to whether the man charged with the murder of Carroty Nell is the murderer known as Jack the Ripper. The inhabitants of Whitechapel believe that he is, but the police have not committed themselves to an opinion on the subject up to the present."

A companion fiend to Jack the Ripper, only on a somewhat lesser scale, was sent to Broadmoor insane asylum today, there to be confined during what is known as ""Her Majesty's pleasure,"" and which practically means life. His name is Edward Colocitt, and he is the young son of a wealthy jeweler of this city. Some time ago the police authorities commenced to receive numnerous complaints from young women in the western suburbs to the effect that while out after dark they were approached by a younf man who came suddenly up behind them, and stabbed them in the back with a sharp instrument about the thickness of an awl. Extra detectives were put on duty in the districts from which the complaint came, but for some time without result. A couple of weeks ago, however, a furniture dealer noticed Collocitt standing behind a couple of young ladies in a suspicious manner, and determined to watch him. Suddenly he made a step forward, and gave one of the young women three stabs with his right hand in the back. Then he took to his heels, but was followed by Myers, the man in question, and arrested. After the fact of his incarceration was made known nineteen women identidied him as their assailant. Six of these gave evidence in court, and the doctors testified that all of them had one or more clean cut, punctured wounds on portions of their anatomy immediately below the hip joint, and which had evidently been made by a very pointed awl. A weapon of this kind was thrown away by Collocitt while he was being pursued. It was testified that the total number of his victims was over sixty. The jury promptly found him guilty, but, on account of his wealthy connections, the plea that he was of weak intellect had its effect, and instead of going to the penitentiary he ws committed to the lunatic asylum. One feature of his mania consisted of his selecting as victims plump young girls between the age of 14 and 18. "

[Copyright, 1888, by James Gordon Bennett.]LONDON, Oct. 5. - The perpetrator of the Whitechapel murders is still at large and no clew has been discovered likely to lead to his capture. No further arrest of any one has been made. The excitement in the neighborhood of the murderer's terrible exploits shows no diminution in intensity. It has been ministered to all day by a series of rumors of a particularly sanguinary character, but they have not the slightest truth in them. A cable dispatch about the Dodge story in New York of Alaska, the Malay, excited considerable interest in police circles, and immediately upon the receipt of a copy of the cablegram detectives were sent to make inquiries at the Glen Line Steamship Company's, the Home for Asiatics, and at other places in the East End where it was likely information respecting the Malay could be obtained. Mr. Freeman, manager and Superintendent of the Asiatic Home, said he had been at the home for thirty years and had never known a Malay of the name Alaska. Malays, he said, are Mohammedans and do not use European names, but the word ""lascar"" is the Mohammedan name for seaman, and Dodge might have been misled. Recently, a crew of Japanese sailors had lodged at the home, and Mr. Freeman admitted that one of these men was a desperate character, for on one occasion he stabbed three of his comrades who were staying in the home. He was arrested, but when his trial came on the injured men had taken ship and gone away. The Queen's Music-Hall, where Dodge says he met Alaska, is most luxuriously fitted up, in a style equal to many of the West End music-halls. Mr. Wood, the manager, says that he had heard nothing of the alleged robbery of the Malay, and referred his inquirer to two attendants, Alexander Nowland and Henry Pierce, who look after the boxes in which sailors just returned from a voyage usually disport themselves. Both men declared that no such robbery could have taken place on the premises without their hearing of it, and as far as they were aware no such thing had happened. Axel Welin, Secretary of the Scandinavian Sailor's Temperance House, West India docks, is extremely popular with foreign sailors. He ransacked his books, but could find no trace either of Dodge or the Malay. Messrs. Magregor's Son & Co., owners of the Glen Line of steamers trading to Singapore, China, etc., stated that the Glenartney sailed in April from London for China and returned Aug. 14. After taking in a cargo at Antwerp she again sailed for China Sept. 8 and was last reported Sept. 23 at Suez. They have no one named Alaska on board. The chief cook of the Glenartney is a thoroughly respectable Chinaman, who has been in the service of the firm for many years, and they have had no Malays on the ship. It is the general opinion that the story of the seaman at New York is a yarn.ANOTHER VIEW.LONDON, Oct. 5. - Sir Charles Warren, Chief of the Metropolitan Police Force, has decided to employ bloodhounds in his efforts to discover the perpetrator of the Whitechapel murder.The police place confidence in the story of George M. Dodge, a seaman, who says that in August last he met a Malay cook named Alaska, with whom he had previously been acquainted on shipboard, in a music hall in London, and that Alaska told him he had been robbed of all he had by a woman of the town, and threatened that unless he found the woman and recovered his property he would kill and mutilate every Whitechapel woman he met. The police are searching everywhere for the Malay.Acting on information which has been furnished them the police who are investigating the Whitechapel murders have seized and occupied several houses in that section."

Co., N. Y. World.]LONDON, Oct. 6. - The horrors of Whitechapel are no blacker than they were a week ago, but the terror in the district and the public excitement are not one whit decreased. The maniac murderer is still in the district and no one knows when he will select another victim for merciless mutilation.I learned today from a Scotland Yard man working on the case that the mysterious American who was here a few months ago offering money for specimens of the parts taken from the bodies of the victims has been discovered. He is a reputable physician in Philadelphia with a large practice, who was over here preparing a medical work on specific diseases. He went to King's College and Middlesex Hospitals and asked for specimens, and merely said he was willing to pay well if he could not get them otherwise. The statement that he offered £20 each or named any other large sum seems to be a delusion of the Coroner. These facts were given the police by an eminent London physician, who saw a great deal of the Philadelphian when he was here, but would only divulge the information on a written guarantee from Sir Charles Warren that neither his name nor the name of the physician in question should be given to the public. He said the doctor had gone back to America, and his mission here was purely legitimate.An American who used to live in New York keeps a herb shop now in the Whitechapel district. A detective called at his place this week and asked him if he had sold any unusual compound of herbs to a customer since August. Similar inquiries were made at other shops in the neighborhood. The basis of this investigation has a startling Shakespearean flavor. An eminent engineer in London suggested to the police the theory that the murderer was a medical maniac trying to find the elixir of life and was looking for the essential ingredient in the parts taken from the murdered bodies; that, like the witches in ""Macbeth,"" he spent the time over a bubbling caldron of the hellbroth made from the gory ingredients looking for the charm.The fact that the police are spending time looking up wild theories like this only shows the utter absence of anything like a clew. The wildest rumors are credited to the exclusion of sound ideas. The Whitechapel district is swarming with detectives, some disguised as laborers, talking with loose women and endeavoring to find out from them something to give the police a tangible basis to work on. Some private detective agencies, tempted by the $8,000 reward, have got decoy women in the street, but all avails nothing. Innumerable arrests have been made, but no one is now in custody.Meanwhile Warren pays no attention to the public clamor for his resignation. The qualities in his character which make him ready to resign if thwarted by his superiors turn him into a leech in holding on when he believes he has done his duty, even though his purpose be not attained. But in the Police Department itself Warren has started an inquisition. He suspects, and probably with good reason, members of his own force with writing letters to the newspapers about him, and has been making a big row about it. He made a rule this week that every newspaper man calling at Scotland Yard must register his name and business in a book."

Said one today who knew the doctor: ""The fellow's name is Tumblety.  About 33 years ago there came to Boston from the Canadian provinces a man who engaged an office in the Horticultural Building on Tremont street.  He was a quack doctor, and during his stay in Boston used considerable ground gentian.  I remember this fact for I sold him quite a large amount of goods from time to time.  When I knew him I was a boy in my teens.  His name was Dr. Tumblety.  I remember him as a rather tall, fine-appearing individual.  He was a most peculiar person.  He wore, pinned to his vest, several large medals which he said had been awarded him in various colleges where he had studied. He liked to display heavy jewelry.  He had every appearance as a quack doctor. I should say he was about 30 years old when I knew him.  He liked the slums, notwithstanding the fact that he always had plenty of money, and could have entered, if he had been inclined, into good society."""

TUMBLETY'S CAREER.Where His Office was and What He Did In and Around New York.New York, Nov. 24. - (Special.)  Police Superintendent Campbell of Brooklyn has been investigating a little of the life of Dr. Tumblety, now under arrest in London on suspicion of being ""Jack the Ripper.""   The Superintendent finds that during the few years that Tumblety spent in Brooklyn he conducted himself properly and attended strictly to business, but was regarded by the more sensible portion of the community as a sort of humbug who palmed off his nostrums on those who are always ready to patronize every mountebank who comes along.  The doctor was a tall, well-built man, with a big flowing mustache, which was a good walking advertisement, for everybody used to ask when he appeared on the street who he was.  He wore a short sack velvet coat, a velvet cap, and high top patent leather boots with his trousers tucked inside.  He had a herb store at Fulton and Nassau streets with a glass case in front.  Among other things in this case was a sort of glass siphon with a red liquid running through a thin glass tube to indicate blood.  He was known as ""The Great Pimple Banisher,"" and he used to promenade Fulton street with two large greyhounds and a valet.   His place was largely patronized by women of all classes. He handed a friend of his $10,000 to keep for him one day, and this friend, after having the money some weeks, had hard work to get the doctor to take it.  He was a man who delighted in notoriety, but those in Brooklyn who know him think the notoriety he is getting as the suspected slayer of the unfortunate women in Whitechapel is certainly undesirable.  No one in Brooklyn believes that he is the murderer or that he knows aught about it."

The Police Capture a Man Who Had Attempted a Murder in Whitechapel.London, July 19. The fever of fear in the Whitechapel district was intensified today by an alleged confession of eight murders and an attempt at a ninth. The story of the confession was told with such precise details that even the police were deceived by it, and did not discover until they had startled the whole city with the news that they were listening to the drivelings of an idiot.Towards midnight the life of another woman was attempted close by Castle alley. A woman and a man were seen to approach the dark portion of the thoroughfare near Aldgate East Station. The pair did not remain long at the corner before the woman was heard to cry, ""No, I won't."" The remark was addressed to a dark man of medium height, with a slouch hat and foreign appearance. The man seized her and dragged her a short distance, then flung her upon the curb and produced a dagger. Her screams of ""Jack the Ripper"", ""Murder"", attracted crowds of men and women from all directions. Among the first arrivals at the scene were several members of the local vigilance association, who had just resumed work. Before the man had time to get far he was seized and a dreadful struggle ensued. He had a long knife in his hand and it was some time before he could be deprived of it. It was eventually taken from him. Even then his fight for liberty was determined. In the fray the woman crawled away. Police whistles were heard from all directions, and a great number of officers, both city and metropolitan force, were soon on the scene.When the police came up the man was cut and bleeding profusely from wounds inflicted by the crowd, which had raised a cry of ""Lynch him!"" throwing all kinds of missiles at the exhausted prisoner. Under strong escort of police he was got to the police station, where he was charged. In reply to the charge he said, ""The woman robbed me."" When asked why he drew his dagger, he replied, ""In self-defense."" He said he was a sailor and gave a Scotch name. He claims to have arrived from South Shields about a week ago. When asked where he was the morning of the 17th inst. he could not say. He did not know where he had staid while in London. A smaller knife was found on his person, together with a seaman's discharge.The sailor was discharged, the police being satisfied that his story was true.London, July 20. - Perhaps Jack the Ripper has changed the scene of his operations. At 2 o'clock this Saturday morning a murderous attack was made on a woman on the Surrey side of the Thames, about two miles from Whitechapel and on the opposite side of the river. The man was armed with a knife. The police were attracted by the shrieks of the woman and arrived on the scene in time to capture the would-be assassin. He was locked up. The woman is in police custody. She may recover. The identity of the man is not established, but hopes are entertained that he may be the Ripper.See also: follow-up article to the Surrey-side attack."

A DESCRIPTION OF THE TERROR OF WHITECHAPEL.A Green Grocer's Clerk Saw the Murderer Just After His Attempt to Butcher Dark Sarah.Special Cable Dispatch To The Tribune.London, July 22. -- Curiously enough an accurate description of Jack The Ripper has been published. He was seen by two persons who know him as the Ripper, and information was given by these to the police. The latter have kept it until today, when it was secured by the writer. The Ripper's first botched job was accomplished Nov. 21 at No. 19 George street, Whitechapel. There he attempted to murder Dark Sarah, but only succeeded in cutting her throat, as the woman was unusually strong. Dark Sarah met him in a public house and remembers him well. She was kept out of sight by the police until the case was overshadowed by the Ripper's successful efforts at murder. Where she is  now is not known.The other person who saw the Ripper is Frank Ruffell, driver of a green grocer's wagon. He is a level-headed young man of 25. His identity was closely concealed by the police. Ruffell said today: ""The morning when the trouble took place, at 18 George street, I was out with the van delivering coke to lodging houses. We furnish coke to nearly all the lodging houses about here. I was standing on the sidewalk in front of the house next to No.19. I was about ten feet from the door when a man came out and walked rapidly towards me. He was about 30 years old. I could not tell what kind of business he was in. He did not look like a workingman, but did not look like a gentleman. He had on a black diagonal suit, his hat was a black round felt, and he had a light mustache cut off square at the ends. It was neither thick nor thin, but about medium. He was about three inches taller than I am, and I am five feet four. He had a straight nose of medium size. I did not notice his eyes particularly, but I should think from the color of his mustache that they were blue [fair hair = blue eyes?] . When he came out of the door he was buttoning the top button of his coat. It was a cutaway coat. He had no collar on. He put his hand up to his mouth, which was bleeding on the right side. As he passed me he looked at me with a sort of smile and muttered a vile remark. I said nothing. Just after he passed me he began to run. Then I heard a cry in No. 19 and saw a woman come down. She said to stop the man and I started after him. By this time he had turned the corner and was out of sight. It was at least three minutes after he went away before I started after him. When I got to the corner, I could not see him. He had time to reach Brick Lane and turn the corner, but when we got there, two policemen said they had not seen anybody. I think he must have turned down the court or he would have been seen. That is all I know about him. Two detectives came for me after the woman had been taken to the hospital and questioned me closely about the matter. I would know the man if I saw him again and could identify his photographs, as I had a close view.""Whitechapel is generally resuming its everyday appearance. Its denizens, generally speaking, are a callous lot; even the women, who now walk in pairs for protection, will soon recover from their fear and reach that condition of mind that the Ripper seems to understand so well and that makes his dreadful work so easy of accomplishment."

John F.  Flower, in whose family she worked two years ago, identified the body. She told him she was born in Canada and married a sea  captain named Charles Brown. Two women employed in Belleview Hospital also identified the body.Another arrest has been made that tallies with the description of the supposed Jack the Ripper. Two park policemen found the  man in City Hall Park. He wore a sand colored coat and blue trousers, and, if any thing, was scarcely shabby enough for the  companion of the degraded victim at the slum lodging house what fatal night. The man, whose name is said to be Henry Young,  was examined at the Oak Street station, confronted with ""Frenchy's"" cousin, and later taken to police headquarters. The  newspaper men were meanwhile driven out of the station house, so great was the desire to keep quiet the actual bent of the  police work and the facts learned thereby.The territory of the precinct where the butchery occurred is simply swarming with detectives. Their actual work, whatever it  is, is enveloped in clouds.

Shortly before two o'clock on Sunday morning it was discovered that a woman had been murdered and horribly mutilated in Mitre-square, Aldgate. It appears that Police-constable Watkins, 881, was going round his beat, when he saw the body of a woman, apparently lifeless, lying in a pool of blood. Upon the arrival of Dr. Gordon Brown, the divisional police doctor, it was discovered that the woman was quite dead. Her throat was cut half-way round, and blood had flowed out in great quantities from the wound, staining the pavement for some distance. Inspector Collard, who was in command at the Bishopsgate Police-station at the time the body was discovered, arrived quickly upon the scene, which was afterwards visited by Major Smith and Superintendent Foster. The City detectives have now the matter in hand. The Lord Mayor (representing the Corporation) has offered a reward of £500 to any person who will give such information as shall lead to the apprehension of the murderer. This fact alone has probably allayed the fears of the Eastenders, and the City authorities have been thanked for their prompt action in the matter. Motions to the effect that the Corporation should offer rewards had been placed upon to-morrow's paper of business by Mr. L. H. Phillips and Mr. S. Price, but these have, of course, been withdrawn, as a result of the Lord Mayor's action. Other rewards have been offered by Mr. H. Marks, of the Financial News, and Colonel Sir Alfred Kirby, on behalf of the Tower Hamlets Engineers. Sir Alfred has also expressed his willingness to place the services of 50 members of his corps at the disposal of the authorities, to be utilized in any way they may consider desirable at this juncture, either for the protection of the public or the detection of the criminals.The inquest on the body of the unfortunate woman will be opened at the Golden-lane mortuary to-morrow.ROBBERY  AT  ALDGATE.WHEN the Post Office in High-street, Aldgate, was opened on Monday morning, only a few yards from where the murder was committed, it was discovered that it had been entered by burglars, and the safe forced. £370 was locked in one draw of the safe, and there was about £70 in a bowl just inside one of the compartments. Stamps to the amount of £350 were also in the safe. The burglars carried off the money in the bowl and the stamps, but could not force the draw in which the larger amount of money was locked. £3 belonging to the postmaster was also taken from an upper room in the house. The post office was entered from an adjoining empty house. No clue to the thief has been obtained up to the present."

S. Scarborough, of the Halifax bench. In all cases the City Police courteously received them.A man who entered a restaurant in Milk-street on Wednesday, and acted in a very suspicious manner, was detained for some hours at the Chief Office, Old Jewry, but was ultimately discharged. He exposed a small knife, and an instrument for injecting morphia. He had a light overcoat stained with blood, and is reported to have said, ""If this coat could speak it would be worth a £1000; I lent it to a man last Saturday.""On Tuesday, a meeting was convened in Leadenhall House, Leadenhall-street, regarding the need of special measures to track the murderer. Numerous suggestions have found their way to the papers. One is that a bloodhound should be put upon the murderer's track.On Thursday the inquest on Catherine Eddowes, alias Kelly, who was so cruelly murdered in Mitre-square, Aldgate, was opened by Mr. S. F. Langham, the City coroner, at the mortuary, in Golden-lane, Barbican. There was a considerable crowd outside of the building during the day. Mr. H. H. Crawford, (the City Solicitor) was present on behalf of the Corporation, and very materially assisted in the inquiry. Colonel Sir James Fraser, K.C.B., Commissioner of Police; Major Smith, Assistant Commissioner; and Superintendent Foster represented the City Police. Mr. Foster, jun., laid before the jury a plan of Mitre-square. This plan showed the woman as she was lying in the square and on the floor of the mortuary. It also included an accurate drawing of the mutilations of the body. For this sketch Mr. Foster was complimented by the Coroner, Dr. Sedgwick Saunders, Dr. Brown, and others. The evidence of identification was taken first, an elderly woman, named Gold, stating the deceased was her sister. The evidence, however, which created the greatest excitement, was that given by Dr. Gordon Brown, the surgeon of the City Police. At the conclusion of the doctor's evidence, which occupied two hours, the inquest was adjourned for a week. The jury expressed great satisfaction at the prompt measures taken by the Lord Mayor in offering a reward.GUILDHALL.WEDNESDAY.(Before Mr. Alderman STONE.)A CONFESSION WHEN DRUNK. - William Bull, of 6, Stannard-road, Dalston, was charged, upon his own confession, with the murder of a woman in Aldgate. Inspector Izzard deposed that on Tuesday night, about twenty to eleven, he was on duty at Bishopsgate police-station, when the prisoner came to him, and made a confession. After writing it down in his presence, and cautioning him, witness asked him if it was right, he replied in the affirmative, giving details of the occurrence. Subsequently witness asked him what had become of the clothes he was wearing at the time of the murder. He replied, ""If you wish to know, they are in the Lea. The knife I threw away."" Prisoner was very drunk. Sergeant Miles, who was instructed to make inquiries, found he was not known at the London Hospital. Defendant's father said that he (accused) was not out on Saturday. Prisoner's parents were highly-respectable people. The Alderman (to accused): Have you any question to ask the witness? Defendant: No; when I made that confession I was mad drunk; I could not do it. The Alderman remanded him so that further inquiries might be made, and refused to accept bail.THE  MITRE-SQUARE  MURDER.The LORD MAYOR said: The Court is aware of the course I was advised and thought it right to take, as to the prompt offer, in the name of the Corporation, of a substantial reward for the apprehension of the Mitre-square murderer, and I am glad to see that not only is public opinion satisfied, by, judging from the paper of business, the Court is equally so. I will only now ask the Court to endorse that which I have done in its name, and I am sure we all join in the earnest hope that the perpetrator or perpetrators of these hideous crimes will be speedily detected. (Cheers).Mr. F. Green said he was sure the Court would endorse the action of the Lord Mayor, and he moved, ""That the Court do entirely approve of the action of the Lord Mayor in directing the offer of a reward of £500 for the discovery and conviction of the Mitre-square murderer or murderers, and that the amount, if properly claimed, be paid out of the City's cash.""Mr. Alderman Cowan seconded the motion, observing that he was one of the earliest to advise the Lord Mayor to take the course he had adopted.The motion was then agreed nem. con.Amongst the motions on the paper was one by Mr. L. H. Phillips: ""That this Court do offer a reward of £250, to be paid out of the City's cash, to any person or persons by whose aid, information, or evidence, the perpetrator or perpetrators of the recent atrocious murders in the East-end, or any of them, shall be convicted.""Mr. Price to move: ""That a reward of £200 be offered and be paid out of the City's cash, to any person who shall give such information as will lead to the apprehension and conviction of the murderer of the woman who was found dead on Sunday morning last in Mitre-square, within the precincts of this City."" As an amendment to which, Mr. Alderman Cowan was to move, ""That the reward be £500 instead of £200.""Mr. J. Pound to move: ""That a reward of £500 be forthwith offered for the apprehension of the perpetrator of the atrocious murder committed in Mitre-square, Aldgate, at or shortly after midnight on Saturday 29th last.""These resolutions apparently fell to the ground in consequence of the action of the Court.

A man is now under detention under suspicious circumstances. He called on Monday at the Clothing Repairing Company in Gray's-inn-road. He left a coat to be repaired which was marked with blood. Inquiries are being made of his antecedents. The remains of Catherine Eddowes, the woman murdered in Mitre-square, were interred on Monday in the City of London Cemetery, Ilford. The Corporation remitted the fees. There was an immense concourse of people to watch the removal of the body from the mortuary in Golden-lane; indeed, a large number of persons assembled along the entire route. It is somewhat worthy of remark that Mitre-square has been the scene of several tragic acts. The men charged with blowing up a portion of the Tower with dynamite were arrested here; and some twenty years ago two men - who were making what was known as fiery serpents - blew up the house in which they lived, and, of course, killed themselves.The committee of the Christian Instruction Society held a special prayer meeting in the hall of the City of London Young Men's Christian Association, Aldersgate-street on Monday morning, the topic being ""The Recent Fiendish Atrocities in Our Midst"". Mr. R. PATON occupied the chair. The Rev. Dr. Tyler (of Mile End New Town), in the course of an address on the above subject, remarked that he had been familiar with the locality in which the murders were committed for more than half a century. His church was situated in the very centre of the scenes of the recent crimes, the public mortuary being on one side of it, and Hanbury-street on the other. One of his people had charge of the mortuary, and the description he had given of the mutilated remains was such that he could not possibly repeat at that meeting. The fact that the death of the victims was almost immediate was about the only consolatory aspect to be drawn from the atrocious crimes. There was an agitation in the country at the present time which was not justified. There had recently been a statement in the Times newspaper to the effect that there had been a decrease of murders throughout the country during the past few years. That was a sign rather hopeful than otherwise. As an instance of the precocity of the children of Whitechapel, he said that some years ago he dropped a ring whilst passing through one of the streets. He stooped to pick it up, when immediately a little creature about the height of the table went up to him and said, ""That's mine, sir; I lost it last night"". (Laughter). He had no hesitation in saying, however, that twenty of thirty years ago the people were very much worse than they are now. Lord Shaftesbury's Act had done very much towards improving the habitations of the people and their social condition. What London had now to fear and to dread was the importation of the scum and depraved characters from all parts of this and other countries. Russians and Poles came into London in very considerable numbers, very largely to escape conscription. Dregs of society coming down, as they did, into London and occupying the low lodging-houses, made the centre a very difficult one for the police to deal with. He did not think, however, that there was a lodging-house in the whole district where people would not listen to the sound of the Gospel, and he hoped that one of the results of that gathering would be to stir up the hearts of many to visit the people and to teach them the Word of God.  Mr. Owen Evans followed in a similar strain, and prayers were also offered. The proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the chairman."

Langham resumed the inquiry into the circumstances attending the death of Catherine Eddowes, aged 43, who was found murdered and mutilated in Mitre-square, Aldgate, on Sunday morning, the 30th ult. Mr. H. H. Crawford, the City Solicitor, represented the Corporation. Superintendent Foster and Detective-sergeant Outram watched the case on behalf of the police. Dr. Sedgwick Saunders said he had examined the contents of the stomach with the view of seeing whether it contained any poison of a narcotic kind. The results were negative, there being not the slightest trace of any kind of poison. Evidence was given by Mrs. Annie Phillips (daughter of deceased), Dr. Sequeira, Detective-sergeant Mitchell, Dr. Gordon Brown, Police-constable Robinson, Police-constable Harvey, Police-constable Long, Police-sergeant Byfield, George Hutt (gaoler at Bishopsgate Police Station), George J.

H. Levy (also at the club on the night in question), and Detective Halse. The jury then, without hesitation, returned a verdict of Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown. Edwin Shelton, the coroner's officer and ward beadle, rendered considerable assistance in connexion with the inquiry. Sir A. Kirby, colonel of the Tower Hamlets Engineers, has made an offer to provide forty or fifty men for service in connexion with tracking the perpetrator of the Whitechapel and Aldgate tragedies. The Home Secretary has written to Sir Alfred, saying that, having consulted Sir Charles Warren, he had come to the conclusion that it would not be advisable to put the men on for service. Mr. Edwin Brough writes: ""My hounds have not been purchased by Sir Charles Warren for the use of the police as has been stated."" Up to an early hour this morning no arrest has been made in connexion with the murder.THE Jewish Chronicle says: ""We are authorized by Dr. Gordon Brown to state, with reference to a suggestion that the City and Whitechapel murders were the work of a Jewish slaughterer, that he had examined the knives used by the Jewish slaughterers, and he is thoroughly satisfied that none of them could have been used.""AT St. John the Evangelist, Commercial-road - which is within the parish in which the Berner-street murder took place - special intercessory services were held on Wednesday. The church was open all day, those who took advantage of the opportunity that was offered for meditation and prayer being very numerous. At one of the services a letter from the Bishop of Bedford, sympathizing with the parish in its present time of trouble was read.DR. BARNARDO has been interviewed, and he thinks that the licensed lodging-house should not be allowed to admit young children. ""It is desirable that the existing law relating to the custody and companionship of children should be more rigidly enforced. At the same time, some provision is urgently required for the shelter of young children of the casual or tramp class, something between the casual wards of the workhouse and the lodging-house itself - places where only  young people under sixteen would be admitted, where they would be free to enter and as free to depart, and which could be made self-supporting, or nearly so."""

One is, that the class of women known as ""unfortunates"" should be registered, and, if needs be, licensed. The other is, that should there be a house-to-house visitation, the visitors being in correspondence with the various philanthropic societies, who would render assistance for rescue and relief. The first is no doubt open to many objections, for while it would clear the streets and protect the women from such murderous assaults as have recently been committed in solitary places, it would cut off almost every chance of return to the path of virtue, and would, in a sense, legalize vice and enthrone immorality. The second suggestion is worth more consideration, and could be at once put in operation. I think, however, the work of visitation and rescue is more fit for women and men, and certainly it ought not to be entrusted to the police, as Mr. Rogers proposes."

His absence from the hive of activity in the Old Jewry will be marked, and is already regretted, as Mr. Sagar has for many years been one of the most popular figures in the detective department at the City Police headquarters. The interesting history of his early association with the City of London Police has yet to be written, and it could only be written by one man, and that man Mr. Sagar himself.A Lancashire man by birth, he was educated at Whalley Grammar School, and found himself, as quite a young man, in London, with the aims and aspirations of a medical student. He became attached to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and intended prosecuting his studies there with all the vigour which he subsequently displayed in quite another and surprising direction. He took apartments in Bartholomew Close, in the house of a celebrated City detective named Potts, who seems to have been a first edition of Sherlock Holmes. The mind and imagination of the young medical student became diverted from the study of surgery and medicine to the fascinating problem of criminology, and the varied means which a quick intelligence offered for the detection of crime. Hence it was that, while engaged as a student at St. Bartholomew's, he became imbued with the instincts of a detective, and so successful was he in that direction that he appeared in a great number of prosecutions of criminals at the City Police Courts and at the Old Bailey. Young Sagar's ability attracted the attention of the late Sir James Fraser, who was at that time the Commissioner of City Police, and he called for a special report with respect to the many cases in which the young medical student had been engaged. The report was of so complimentary a character that the Commissioner suggested that Mr. Sagar should join the police force. In the event of his declining to do so, a handsome cheque was ready as payment for his past assistance to the police. Mr. Sagar thereupon resolved to abandon the dull routine of the medical profession in favour of the more exciting, but less remunerative, life of a detective. The circumstances of his joining the police force were, therefore, peculiar, but that is not the only unusual feature associated with it, as Detective-inspector Sagar is the only officer of the City of London Police who has never donned a uniform.He joined the service in January, 1880, as an ordinary constable, and, as usual, was required to undergo a month's probation. After having completed half that time, he was selected by the late Sir James Fraser to make an investigation into a particularly intricate case of forgery, in the task of unravelling which several others had tried and failed. Mr. Sagar at once responded to the call, and proceeded into the country for the purpose of securing his quarry. Fortune favoured him, and he was successful in bringing the forger to justice, a sentence of twenty years' penal servitude being the fate of the man who had so long escaped detection. Mr. Sagar then returned to the City and completed the remainder of the period of probation.In December, 1888, he was promoted to the position of sergeant, there being no vacancy on the detective staff. The title was one of an honorary character, and it was conferred by the Commissioner in recognition of special services rendered. In the following June he was appointed detective-sergeant, and in November, 1890, he was promoted to the post of detective-inspector. Three years later he was made a first-class inspector. It is a matter of some interest to know that, on the occasion of his joining the police force, he was rejected on medical examination, it being supposed that he was suffering from a varicose vein in one leg. There was no doubt that he had received an injury to one of his legs, and it came about in this wise: Before he joined the service he was in the City one day with the late Detective James Egan. He noticed a robbery from a shop in Fore Street, and both men started off in pursuit of the thief, who dashed down into Chapel Street. That thoroughfare was being repaved, and, consequently, they ran along the kerb. Unfortunately, one of the workmen had left a pick projecting over the kerb, and young Sagar, not seeing the obstacle in time to avoid it, had the misfortune to strike his shin against the iron point, the result being that a portion of the cloth of his trousers was driven into the hole caused by the displaced muscle. Nothing daunted, he continued the pursuit, and the thief was ultimately run to earth. The Commissioner of Police was much struck by the exhibition of such tenacity of purpose in so young a man. Ultimately he passed the medical examination.On another occasion Mr. Sagar stopped two well-known thieves in Chiswell Street, and their agitation in answer to his questions convinced him that something was wrong; but he said nothing more and left them. Soon afterwards a boy passed him wheeling a barrow, on which was a large case. From a point of concealment the detective noticed that there was some connection between the boy and the men, the latter lagging behind in order that the boy and the barrow might come nearer to them in the Barbican. Procuring assistance, Sagar followed on their track, and arrested the trio in the Central Meat Market. Soon after they were brought into the police station a message was received from Bishopsgate to the effect that a case of boots had been stolen in broad daylight from Camomile Street. The case, on being opened, was found to contain the stolen property. The foregoing is one of many instances in which Mr. Sagar displayed his smartness. It was, however, in the detection of forgeries and the running to earth of the forgers that he showed his talents. In the great majority of bank note and other forgeries of recent years, he has taken a leading part. In particular he was instrumental in bringing into the dock at the Old Bailey a notorious gang of forgers of the most expert and dangerous type - all of them foreigners. It may be remembered that one of them shot himself in his cell at the Old Bailey after he had been sentenced. Two other clever forgers, a portion of the same gang, received their deserts only a few days ago. Mr. McWilliam, who recently retired from the head of the detective department at Old Jewry, employed Detective-inspector Sagar in making all the confidential inquiries which needed an exhibition of great tact, caution, and that subtle handling of facts and weighing of evidence which can only be possessed by long experience and careful training. On one occasion the Bank of England wanted to transfer three millions in bullion to the Bank of France in Paris. Detective-inspector Sagar was at once instructed to take all the necessary precautions for the safe transit of so huge a sum. He accomplished his mission successfully, and ""personally conducted"" the last million to Paris.His professional association with the terrible atrocities which were perpetuated some years ago in the East End by the so-styled ""Jack-the Ripper"" was a very close one. Indeed, Mr. Sagar knows as much about those crimes, which terrified the Metropolis, as any detective in London. He was deputed to represent the City police force in conference with the detective heads of the Metropolitan force nightly at Leman Street Police Station during the period covered by those ghastly murders. Much has been said and written - and even more conjectured - upon the subject of the ""Jack-the-Ripper"" murders. It has been asserted that the murderer fled to the Continent, where he perpetrated similar hideous crimes; but that is not the case. The police realised, as also did the public, that the crimes were those of a madman, and suspicion fell upon a man, who, without a doubt, was the murderer. Identification being impossible, he could not be charged. He was, however, placed in a lunatic asylum, and the series of atrocities came to an end. There was a peculiar incident in connection with those tragedies which may have been forgotten. The apron belonging to the woman who was murdered in Mitre Square was thrown under a staircase in a common lodging house in Dorset Street, and someone - presumably the murderer - had written on the wall above it, ""The Jewes are not the people that will be blamed for nothing.""  A police officer engaged in the case, fearing that the writing might lead to an onslaught upon the Jews in the neighbourhood, rubbed the writing from the wall, and all record of the implied accusation was lost; but the fact that such an ambiguous message was left is recorded among the archives at the Guildhall. Detective-inspector Sagar, who has made several journeys abroad for the purpose of securing celebrated criminals, is none the worse for his many adventures. With all the great raids that have been made in recent years on gaming houses and so-called clubs in the City, Mr. Sagar, we may add, has been prominently identified. Into his retirement he carries with him the good wishes of all who enjoy his friendship, and have profited by his clever brain."

In consequence of this information, the coroner states his belief that the murders were committed by  some anatomist desirous of obtaining human organs for a medical exhibition in America.The investigation of the Whitechapel murders still continues and it has been ascertained that an  American offered the curator of a London hospital the sum of £20 for each specimen of part of an  internal organ he could procure for him. The applicant stated his object in endeavoring to secure these  specimens was to issue an actual specimen with a copy of a new medical work to be published shortly,  and he desired that they should be packed in glycerine to preserve them. The curator refused to  entertain the proposal. Acting on the information of the coroner, the police arrested a man named  Fitzgerald on a charge of murder, and he has confessed to having committed the latest crime. At 2.20 on Sunday morning, near the junction of Leadenhall and Fenchurch streets, Aldgate, the body of  a woman aged about 35 years was discovered. It was completely disembowelled and the nose was severed  from the face.An hour earlier the body of another woman, with the throat cut, was discovered in a back yard in  Berners street, but as the body was not mutilated in any way it is not thought that the murder was of  the same class as those that have been reported lately.In consequence of the discovery of the mutilated body in Leadenhall street there is great excitement in  the city.

He also thought that the symptoms in the case of Mr. Maybrick  accorded with those of gastro-enteritis.A chemist testified that ladies often purchase fly papers for use as a cosmetic. A hairdresser said that arsenic was  frequently used by ladies to improve their complexion.Mr. Poole, ex mayor of Liverpool, testified that in March last Mr. Maybrick had told him that he took poisonous medicines  habitually. This concluded the evidence and Mrs. Maybrick then read her statement. In this she explained the presence of the  fly papers in the house by saying that she had bought them for use as cosmetics. In former years she had used a cosmetic  prescribed by Dr. Griggs, of Brooklyn which contained arsenic. She lost the prescription, and wishing to make a substitute  had soaked the fly papers in elder flower water and lavender water and had covered the mixture with a plate and a towel to  exclude the air. Continuing, Mrs. Maybrick said: ""On the night of May 9th, after the nurse in attendance upon my husband had  given him some meat juice. I went and sat by his bed. He complained of being very sick and depressed and implored me to give  him a powder. Earlier in the day he had made a similar request and I had declined to administer the powder, but that evening  I was over-wrought, terribly anxious and miserably unhappy. His distress unnerved me and as he said the powder was harmless  and I could put it in his feed, I consented to put it with some meat juice which I gave to him. After taking it deceased fell  asleep and appeared better on awakening. I was not anxious to administer the powder. Afterwards I placed the bottle  containing the meat juice on the wash stand where it remained until Michael Maybrick, my brother in law, took possession of  it.

The blood stains were examined microscopically by Dr. Phillips, the police surgeon attached to the Leman street police station.  Dr. Phillips has no doubt that the stains are those of human blood. This formidable knife has been traced to the possession of Sadler, who as already stated was a fireman on board a steamer which recently arrived from Turkey. The police have no doubt that Sadler was the murderer of Carrotty Nell.From the time that it became known that Sadler had been arrested and was formally charged with the murder of Carrotty Nell, the greatest excitement has prevailed in and about Whitechapel. The police station where the prisoner is detained is surrounded by a vast crowd of people, mostly women. The women are eager for a sight of the prisoner. Wild threats of lynching and tearing the prisoner to pieces were uttered by the most excited of these females. When the man was removed to the police court an immense force of police was employed and every precaution was necessary in order to prevent the Whitechapel mob from lynching the man.Opinions differ as to whether the man charged with the murder of Carrotty Nell is the murderer known as Jack the Ripper. The inhabitants of Whitechapel believe that he is, but the police have not committed themselves to an opinion on the subject up to the present time."

But his victims belong to the same class of women as those killed by the Ripper, he operates in the same areas and, like him, his identity is shrouded in the most impenetrable secrecy.Londoners have already given him a name: Jack the Poisoner.His favorite poison, indeed the only one he uses, is strychnine: in such a way that his victims expire with a terrible rapidity and in unspeakable agonies.The number of killings committed in this way, of which the police are at present aware, has reached seven; but as the investigations started only a short time ago, it is possible that a larger number of victims will be discovered.All these poisonings have been committed in an identical manner, in the same district and within a few months; events which finally attracted the attention of the police, even more so as they have not forgotten the deeds of the Ripper.The crime which finally opened the eyes of the police was committed in the middle of April. Two young women who were sisters, who led immoral lives, met in the street a well dressed man who invited them to take tea. They went with him and in the course of their conversation, the stranger said he was a doctor and made them take some pills. The two unfortunates died within a short time and the post mortem revealed that they had been poisoned with strychnine.The victim before these two was another girl who, while walking in the Waterloo Road, suddenly fell to the ground. She was carried to St. Thomas' hospital and there she died in a short time from strychnine poisoning.The authorities have given few details of the fourth and fifth victims, for they say that their investigations with respect to these cases have not been concluded.The sixth was a young woman of twenty five years of age, who appears to have had some dealings with her killer. The girl died suddenly, but doctors thought that her death was from natural causes. The body has now been exhumed and examination has demonstrated that this unfortunate girl also died of poisoning with the same toxic substance as the other victims.The last, the seventh, was a young girl who also had dealings with her murder for some days and was also buried without the doctors suspecting anything.The police have confirmed that Jack the Poisoner is known as Fred to his victims, claims to be a doctor with almost all of them, is about forty years of age and says he has arrived from America a short time ago. Is this the same Jack the Ripper who has changed his method? Or is it someone different but no less terrible?Such are the questions the London police are currently asking themselves."

It is not a matter of a single killer, but a veritable quartet of Rippers. I have here a telegram on the subject: ""Paris, 8. There are interesting details communicated from London regarding the discovery of the criminals who have so alarmed (public) opinion. This is due to a journalist, a Mr. Tucker of the Daily Telegraph, who had the luck of surprising certain individuals in the act of taking down from a carriage the body of another woman and, summoning help, he succeeded in having arrested by the police Ruckett, Runce and Murphy, those who were taking down the body, and Jack Robinson, who styles himself a doctor of medicine and surgery. The explanations offered by the latter and his complete cold bloodedness present a new case of scientific insanity, namely to solve by the removal of certain organs the problems of poverty and over population."" The police, despite their disguises, patrols and strategies, had been powerless to pick up the trail of the crimes; every investigation proved fruitless. Every night in Whitechapel there were carried out numerous arrests of drunkards and suspicious people, but none of those arrested turned out to be implicated in the crimes they were investigating. A detailed list was made of all uninhabited houses in Whitechapel, of which there are many, with no result. The police had reached the point of releasing tracker dogs on the streets of the said district. Some editors of London newspapers were carrying out their own investigations, patrolling by night the darkest and most dangerous places. One of these, a reporter for the Daily Telegraph, had the good fortune to discover the murderers. Last night, as Mr. Tucker, as he is called, was walking along carrying out his investigations, he saw a carriage stop suddenly in from of a rundown house, which movement struck him as suspicious. He stood watch and saw four men getting down from the carriage and that they were taking down a bulky shape which could well be a body. He drew nearer, and indeed it was the body of a dead woman which those men were unloading. The reporter began to blow on a whistle which he carried for protection, detaining the four men and taking possession of the body. One of those detained is a policeman, another a doctor according to his own claims. The other two are unknown men. The self styled doctor is called Jack Robinson and appears to be the instigator of the crimes. He presented to the superintendent (or possibly commissioner) a self control which demonstrated an unfeeling impassiveness and he claimed that he is dedicated to the fulfilment of a mission of redemption, which consists of reducing the population of the world by sterilizing women, for which reason he was dedicated to the removal of certain organs from his victims for the purpose of studying them. According to him, the resolving of this physiological problem would put an end to misery. It is not known if he is a dangerous madman who suffers from what could be called scientific madness, or an experienced criminal who is seeking immunity by feigning madness. Whatever may be the case, the result is still a fearful aberration which cannot fail to rouse decent consciences and to merit, along with the severest punishment, universal loathing. "

Therefore we are not intending at this point to discuss the  guilt or innocence of the individual named Tumblety whom the Grand Jury in Montreal has just acquitted,  and thereto we have only one word to say: if this individual has escaped the penalty of the law,  despite the serious facts proved against him in the inquiry conducted before the police magistrate,  because of the specialised nature of the accusation, it is, it seems to us, the duty of the authorities  to take up again the pursuit of other areas of accusation which may develop from the evidence of the  inquiry.The various remarks that follow are intended to draw the attention of the public and the legislature,  of whatever type, to the importance of legal medicine insofar as it serves to clarify awareness of the  judges and the accused in a multitude of legal processes. There have often been complaints about the  way medico-legal matters are undertaken and conducted in Canada. Without going over what has been said  at various times, without even putting forward an opinion on the observations of experts in the present  Tumblety case, we believe we must use the opportunity to engage magistrates and doctors of this country  to make a serious study of this question in the interests of the individual and of society.It is to provide proof of the need for reform in the method of procedure that we offer the public the  present Tumblety case in that it concerns the medico-legal expertise that has been produced in this  matter. Tumblety had sold pills and liquids which were supposedly made up of abortive substances, or at  least those which would fall within that category of medicines defined in English criminal law under  the name of ""noxious substances."" The affair promptly and directly revealed one aspect of legal  medicine: for if the medicines were of a completely inoffensive nature Tumblety had committed a  deception in aggravated circumstances, and if on the other hand the medicines were of a type to cause  the least danger to health, under the alleged circumstances, then Tumblety was guilty of an atrocious  crime.The medicines sold by Tumblety have been examined by three experts: Mr. Birks, a chemist from Montreal,  Dr. Sutherland, a professor from Montreal and Mr. Larue, a toxicology from Quebec. The ""Medical  Chronicle"" in its October issue published the testimony given by the first two experts, and Dr. Larue  was very willing to provide us, with permission from the authorities, his report which has not been  published elsewhere and of which we start publication today: we do this at the risk of giving our  readers several columns of material which is for the most part barely intelligible to our subscribers,  with the aim of drawing the attention of all to the important subject of the role of legal medicine in  the evading of criminal punishment, and of airing in the press and especially in specialised  publications appropriate discussion to make known the names and knowledge of these men who have devoted  their efforts to these types of study and who are consequently rendering great benefits to society.In the present Tumblety case, the opinions of the three experts differ completely from each other and,  moreover, on matters which today can hardly be considered scientific areas. As Mr. Birks and Dr.  Sutherland have not, to our knowledge, given a detailed report of the precedures in their laboratory,  but have disclosed only the results of their research, we will report this result as given in the  Medical Chronicle, then we will publish the report of the third expert, Mr. Larue.Who is wrong? Who is right? We are not qualified to pronounce on these issues: but it is obvious that  society and individuals have a great interest to ensure that these very important medico-legal  inquiries should be conducted in such a way as not to condemn without consideration the accused nor to  allow the truly guilty to escape.We are only giving the testimony of  Mr. Birks and Dr. Sutherland insofar as it concerns the  composition of Tumblety's medicines, quoting from the Medical Chronicle:Mr. Birks said: ""After a detailed examination of the contents of this bottle, I found that it contained  black hellebore, or 'hellebonen', and a small quantity of syrup. I have also very carefully examined  three pills and I found that they were composed of cayenne pepper, aloe, savin oil and  cantharides.""Dr. Sutherland on the question: ""What substances do you supposed were used in the composition of these  pills?"" answered:""Mainly aloe and at least two other important ingredients of whose nature I am not sure, perhaps  cayenne pepper and some essential oil... I have examined one pill which was entirely sufficient... I  said that I was certain of the presence of aloe.""The questiones posed to these two experts dealt not only with the composition of the drugs but also  with their abortive qualities. The question posed to Mr. Larue - and which he answers in the report  which follows - dealt exclusively with the composition of the drugs, considering, no doubt, their  general effects as poisons or substances dangerous to bodily health. Report of Mr. Larue.We, Francois Alexandre Hubert LaRue, Licentiate of Medicine, and Professor of Legal Medicine,  Toxicology and Hygiene at the Laval University of Quebec, have been commissioned, 3rd October 1857, by  order of the Honourable Procurator for Lower Canada, by way of an official letter sent to us by Henry  Driscoll, Knight, Queen's Counsel, requiring us to prove the ingredients of a certain liquid and  certain pills. On 3rd October, 1857, at 9:30. we received from the hands of the Grand Constable for the  City of Montreal, M. Delille:1) A phial, of about two ounces capacity, completely filled with a reddish brown liquid; which phial  was stoppered with cork but not sealed2) A white card box containing ten pills, each of five grains, which box was not sealed.The Grand Constable and we, having in turn appended our names and the date - 3rd October 1857 - on the  white label on the phial and on the box, these objects were immediately deposited in an iron case which  was then locked and this case placed in a cupboard which contained no similar substances and this  cupboard itself was locked, the keys being kept in our possession.Monday, 5th October 1857, having provided ourselves with test tubes, ""horns"" and new receptacles etc.  we locked ourselves in the laboratory of the Laval University to which no one had access during the  whole period of our research, the keys remaining at all time in our possession. Being unable to foresee  the number of type of reactions which would be needed in the course of our research we had to ensure  sufficient supply both in quality and amount as might be needed.For the present inquiry, we were content to check the purity of  our distilled water and hydrochloric  acid by use of the normal reagents.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF THE SUBSTANCES:These substances were presented in the least favourable condition (regarding the state of the pills and  the solution) for this examination: Liquid - The liquid, two ounces in quantity, has a reddish brown colour, which takes on a yellowish  appearance when held up to the light from a window. After several hours at rest it deposits a black  substance, extremely tenuous and light, resembling a powder. The quantity of this powder, as near as  can be calculated, would not be more than a quarter of a grain. The small of the liquid is unpleasant,  neither piquant nor acrid - I would not know what other to compare it to. Its taste is sugary,  unpleasant and reminded me of the taste of ""ricin"" oil. This taste is not piquant, acrid, bitter nor  corrosive, being neither acid nor alkaline. The taste exhibited no trace of alcohol and a sample of the  liquid, tipped into a watch glass, did not ignite when a lighted match was brought near. One drop,  tipped onto a sheet of white paper, did not stain it. The liquid has a watery appearance, perhaps  slightly viscous; it does not visibly change the colour of sunflowers (? tournesols)Pills:- The pills, of five grains, are well made and rounded. The external colour is greenish yellow.  They have an odour of spirit of mint which masks any other smell. One of these pills, when divided with  the nail, was when broken open of a reddish brown colour, showing here and there small red grains. The  paste from which these pills are made is fairly homogeneous. The taste is very bitter, a little sugary,  and above all of an extreme piquancy which burns the tongue. The burning that these pills produce on  the tongue is sufficiently painful that I was obliged to rinse my mouth several times to get rid of it,  and it was only by constantly applying cold water to the tongue that I managed to make it stop. This  burning left only a slight redness on the end of the tongue. This burning and pain are absolutely  consistent with those produced by a few graines of cayenne pepper. Two of these graines were extracted  and placed under the microscope with two grains of cayenne pepper, bought from the apothecary, and  presented the same appearance with regard to form and colour. When these two grains were placed on the  tongue they produced this same pain just mentioned.The colour and, above all, the distinctive taste of these grains allow me to conclude the very probable  presence of cayenne pepper in these pills; however I cannot absolutely state this in the present  circumstances.After scraping a portion of one of these pills onto a sheet of white paper, and submitting it to an  examination under the microscope, the substance, instead of exhibiting the reddish brown color it had  shown while the pill was whole, showed a yellow color which stained the paper. There could  be seen  small points of bright white, too small to be separated, and, in addition, those red graines which have  already been discussed; there was no trace of leaves, roots, no insect remains. Spread out with a  little water on a glass slide, the substance exhibited the same yellow colour with a light greenish  reflection.Another pill, after being scraped and examined under the microscope, did not appear so homogeneous in  its formation. Besides the structures observed in  the first pill, others were found in this one, small  light yellow grains, having the appearance of gum. One of them, placed on the tongue, produced a  strongly bitter taste.From the foregoing examination, the results are:1) That in the composition of these pills, there are several substances2) That apart from capsicum (cayenne pepper), whose physical characteristics of colour and taste are  sufficient for me to assume its very probable presence in the pills, the physical and microscopic  examination of these pills produced nothing of note, nothing to justify suspicion as to the presence of  one substance more than another.CHEMICAL ANALYSIS:On the 7th October, we proceeded to the chemical examination of the liquid; as this liquid was  coloured, we proceed to decolour it. the medium used for this was chlorine. But as the introduction of  this gas could produce other reactions from a range of substances, we watered down a sample of the  liquid to the point where it was colourless and divided this into two parts. The first was treated with  hydrochloric acid. After it was well shaken and left to rest for one hour, no precipitate formed.  Therefore there is a complete absence of silver, lead and mercury at the very least.The second part, treated with silver nitrate and left to rest for one hour, showed no reaction.  Therefore there is absence of the following acids: hydrionic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, prussic and  oxalic.In a small green glass globe, washed in preparation with hydrochloric acid and distilled water, we  placed roughly a third of the liquid for examination and we subjected it to a stream of chlorine passed  through distilled water. The liquid discoloured and was then agitated, filtered, treated with  hydrochloric acid and subjected for half an hour to a stream of hydrogen sulphide passed through  distilled water. At the end of this period, a slight, white, milky precipitate had formed. In case the  liquid contained oxidised arsenic, it was again subjected to a stream of hydrogen sulphide and heated.  It formed nothing in addition to this milky white precipitate. The milky character of this precipitate  was too charateristic of the presence of sulphur itself to be confused with some precipitate of  sulphur. However the liquid was left at rest for one hour; at the end of this time the precipitate had  not clotted. In any event, the precipitate, because of its colour, could only be confused with sulphur  of arsenic. The liquid was filtered and the precipitate washed with distilled water, then treated on the  filter with distilled water with added ammonia. If this precipitate were due to the presence of  arsenic, the ammonia would have dissolved it and mixed with it in the test tube; and then the addition  of hydrochloric acid, to saturate the ammonia, would have caused the reappearance of the precipitate.  All these steps were carried out with the greatest care but the hydrochoric acid produced no  precipitate.After this experiment I concluded that there was a complete absence of the following substances in the  liquid: arsenic, tin, antimony, gold, platinum, lead, mercury, copper, cadmium and bismuth.The liquid, already filtered, was then supersaturated with ammonia and treated with ammonia  sulphydrate. When shaken, and after waiting some time, there was no formation of precipitate nor any  reaction whatever.From which we can conclude the complete absence of nickel, cobalt, iron, zinc, manganese, aluminium,  chromium, oxalates and phosphates of barium, strontium, lime, magnesium, aluminium.At this point in the research, fortified by the negative result which the physical examination had  provided, and supported by the negative result of the analysis, we did not fear to experiment on  ourselves.Not having eaten for three hours, we ingested a large soupspoonful of the liquid - this dose did not  produce the slightest symptom.This last experiment leads us to conclude that the liquid, in the amount of one soupspoonful, is not  toxic to humans.TO BE CONTINUED."
283,index/courier_du_canada_18571106.txt,courier_du_canada,1857-11-06,"Le Courier du Canada6 November 1857(Translation from original article)Legal Medicine(Continuation of the report of Mr. Larue)8 October 1857.A sample of the original liquid, the colour having again been removed with chlorine, was divided into  two parts: the first, to which was added ammonia and ammonium carbonate, was treated with sodium  phosphate. After being vigorously stirred, no precipitate formed and there was no reaction after half  an hour. Therefore, an absence of magnesium.The second part of the liquid produced no precipitate when treated with platinum bichlorate. Therefore,  an absence of potassium and ammonia.Not having any potassium antimoniate to hand, the examination for sodium did not proceed.Marsh apparatus produced no colouration whatever.EXAMINATION FOR ACIDS.The liquid had removed from it ammonium sulphydrate and hydrogen sulphide by the use of bismuth hydrate,  was then filtered and made neutral in two ""tournesols"" with acetic acid and ammonia.One part of the liquid was then treated with barium chloride - no precipitate.Thus there is an absence of the following acids: sulphuric, phosphoric, hydrofluoric and oxalic.The absence of hydrochloric and hydrocyanic acids etc. has already been noted.The absence of carbonic and hydrosulphuric acids etc. had already been noted at the beginning of these  experiments by the addition of hydrochloric acid.Having saturated a sample of the original liquid with sodium carbonate and evaporated this to the point  of dryness, we took a portion of the residue and placed this in a test tube with copper filings and some  drops of pure sulphuric acid. This whole mass, brought to boiling point, gave off no odour of  hypoazotic vapour, no orange colouration appeared and some grains of morphine, when exposed to the  vapour from the tube, did not change colour; therefore, an absence of nitric acid.These experiments, therefore, allow us to conclude, as we do, an absence in the liquid of all minerals  and all acids which the examination was deigned to detect.THE PILLS: CHEMICAL ANALYSIS.We again verified the purity of our reagents.In a porcelain bowl, previously washed with distilled water, we placed four pills, which were crushed  and to which was added pure, concentrated sulphuric acid. The whole mass was heated, being continually  stirred with a glass rod. Heated to the point where all vapour had been given off. The carbon deposited  in the bowl, taken up in boiling distilled water, was subjected to the same type of testing as that  used on the liquid: no trace of metals was noted therein.When saturated with ammonia and treated with a moderate quantity of ammonium sulphydrate, a plentiful  black precipitate was formed. The following metals were detected in the precipitate: nickel, cobalt,  iron, zinc, manganese, chromium, aluminium and also phosphates and oxalates. Although the quantity of  precipitate was plentiful in relation to the amount of the liquid used, it was too little to allow a  detailed analysis of all substances present. However, the black colouration of the precipitate could  only be due to the presence of iron, cobalt and nickel. But the fact that it dissolved rapidly in  hydrochloric acid served to demonstrate the definite presence of iron.The liquid was filtered, hydrochloric acid added, then heated to boiling point; it was then neutralised  with ammonia, treated with ammonium carbonate and gently heated. A light cloudiness (""louche"") became  visible. Left arest for half an hour, this cloudiness increased, very probably due to the presence of  lime which occurs in a large number of organic compounds.CONTROL OF THESE TWO EXPERIMENTS.So that no doubt could  be cast on this report by the accidental introduction of extraneous matter in  the course of the lengthy procedures, the foregoing analysis had to be controlled and so it was  performed again.Two and a half pills, divided with a platinum knife, were placed into a porcelain bowl which had been  washed in distilled water. Sulphuric acid was added to this matter and again burned. The mixture was  stirred the whole time with a glass rod which was perfectly clean. Heated, to the point where vapours  had been given off, the carbonised mass was pulverised in the bowl with an agate pestle and was burned.  Treated twice with pure hydrochloric acid, the liquid was divided into two parts. When ammonia was  tipped into the first part, a yellowish precipitate was formed. The addition of ammonia sulphydrate  formed the same black precipitate which displayed the same characteristics as in the first experiment  and demonstrated again the presence of iron.The liquid, when filtered and treated as already discussed, produced this same cloudiness, very probably  due to the presence of lime, of which we have already spoken.When the liquid was heated, filtered, treated with sodium phosphate, a very visible cloudiness  resulted. Therefore, magnesium was present. It is normal for pills to be rolled in magnesium carbonate  after they are made.The liquid was filtered, evaporated to dryness and heated to red heat. The residue was dissolved in  distilled water, boiled with a light infusion of barium water and filtered. Treated with a light amount  of dilute sulphuric acid, heated to boiling point, filtered, evaporated to dryness: the residue, taken  up in a small quantity of water, produced no precipitate when treated with platinum bichlorate;  therefore, an absence of potassium.TESTING FOR ORGANIC SUBSTANCES.When the analysis for inorganic substances had been done, it remained to test for and identify organic  substances. In similar circumstances, usually the expert could assess the effects of poison (symptoms  and tissue lesions) and moreover, he could gather from nature various samples of the substance used  which immediately gives him a very strong suspicion about the nature of the substances. In these  circumstances, and when there is available an appropriate amount of the substances, analysis is  possible, although presenting some difficulties; and the result of the chemical analysis, combined with  the physical characteristics and the effects, can give almost complete certainty.Here, the pills and the liquid being mixtures in nature, giving no recognisable sign of the substances  used (leaves, roots, insect remains etc.); moreover, the taste, the colour, the smell of these  substances giving no specific character (apart perhaps from the capsicum); and, besides, as there had  been no effects as no one had taken these medicines, it followed that chemical analysis alone would be  able to thrown light on the question and this analysis naturally involved methodical and detilaed  research on all the organic substances. Work which is possible on inorganic substances is hardly  available with the present state of science for organic substances. It is quite true that a general  method was proposed by M. Stas in 1845, a method that was followed by Messrs. Orfila, Devergie,  Chevalier. Lassaigne etc. But in most cases only an impure substance was obtainable which was  impossible to characterise physically, even chemically, and one had to be satisfied with various  imperfect reactions. But even assuming this work had been done, even supposing that one had been able to  obtain a subtance in a state of reasonable purity, to allow the use of reagents even in these  favourable circumstances, chemical analysis alone would only have been able to give cause for a slight  suspicion. The reactions which occur in contact with the majority of these organic substances and their  reagents, are far from being characteristic. The colour changes etc., which occur between substances  and their reagents. these same changes, I state, very often happen also between these reagents and  other organic substances. ""If one wanted our whole opinion, ""said M. Galtuier, ""we would place more confidence in the physical  characteristics of substances under investigation viz. smell, colour, taste etc. than in chemical  reactions such as are used in the present state of science.""GENERAL CONCLUSIONS:From all these researches, the results are:1) That the physical examination of the liquid gave us no indication of the nature of the substances  that it contains.2) That the physical and microscopic examination of the pills allowed us to assume the very likely  presence of cayenne pepper.3) That chemical analysis demonstrated the total absence of mineral substances in the liquid.4) That chemical analysis of the pills demonstrated the presence of iron in fairly large quantities, of  magnesium and traces of lime.5) That the discovery by chemical analysis of the organic substances contained in the mixtures under  analysis, is impossible in the present circumstances and in the present state of science.Signed F.A.H.LARUELicenciate of Medicine, Professor etc.     Related pages:  Francis Tumblety       Dissertations: A Slouch Hatted Yank: A Few Thoughts on the Newly Found I...        Dissertations: A Theory on Francis Tumblety        Dissertations: The Canterbury Encore: The Further Adventures of Dr. Tumb...        Dissertations: Tumblety Talks        Message Boards: Francis Tumblety        Official Documents: The Littlechild Letter        Press Reports: Arkansas Gazette -

284,index/croydon_advertiser_18880908.txt,croydon_advertiser,1888-09-08,"Croydon AdvertiserUnited KingdomSaturday September 8th 1888Whitechapel is earning for itself a most unlovely reputation for the frequency with which murders and deeds of violence are perpetrated in its neighbourhood.  That there is a gang of ruffians going about levying blackmail on unfortunate women there can now be little doubt.  The latest victim is a woman who on Monday night was walking with a man, and when they reached a point near to the scene of the murder of the woman Nicholls, the man violently seized his companion by the throat and dragged her down a court.  He was immediately joined by a gang of women and bullies, who stripped the unfortunate woman of her necklace, earrings and brooch.  Her purse was also taken and she was brutally assaulted.  Upon her attempt to shout for aid one of the gang held a large knife across her throat, remarking ""We will serve you as we did the others,"" and no doubt would have carried his threat into effect had the poor woman not ceased to struggle.  When Sir Charles Warren has done with Trafalgar-square perhaps he will turn his attention to this dark spot in the metropolis.But there comes a rumour that will be resolved by Trafalgar-squarites, and indeed by a great many others, with considerable satisfaction, and it is to the effect that Sir Charles will shortly retire from Scotland Yard and he will be appointed to succeed Sir Hercules Robinson as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa.  Let's hope it may prove true."
285,index/croydon_advertiser_18880915.txt,croydon_advertiser,1888-09-15,"Croydon AdvertiserUnited KingdomSaturday September 15th 1888DONE TO DEATHBy DIOGENESIn the yard of the Board of Works, which may be approached either from Whitechapel-road or Eagle-place, stands a mortuary, which during the last few days has been tenanted by the bodies of two unfortunate women, the victims of diabolical treachery and unparalleled ferocity.  The ghastly and mutilated corpse of Mary Ann Nicholls is barely consigned to its last resting-place, and the rough black shell is only just emptied of its grim contents in time to afford accommodation to the desecrated remains of Annie Chapman.  A quiver of abhorrence vibrates through the land, and we rub our eyes and wonder whether it is not the awakening from some horrible nightmare, or at least exaggerated accounts of the actions of ghouls, ere we can realise that we are in the capital of the country that rules the world.  The papers are absolutely crammed with murders and printed in blood.  Whichever way we turn we are greeted with butchery and ghastly sickening details which crowd one upon the other with a regularity that is horrible to contemplate.  A reign of terror has commenced, and so far as the discovery of the perpetrators of those atrocities is concerned we stand paralysed and powerless.  There is not even time for the inquest to be held upon Annie Chapman ere the Thames gives up in the shape of an arm, the indication of another mutilated victim which medical experts declare to be a young and well developed woman.When I heard of the Hanbury-street murder I made up my mind there and then to go eastward and see and hear as much as possible in the neighbourhood on the off-chance of arriving at something like a correct conclusion, and I popped into Croydon's famous  hostelry, the Greyhound, to see the time tables and refresh the inner man. 'Twas there I met a gentleman who volunteered to accompany me upon my dismal mission, and I cannot resist mentioning the fact, since it serves to demonstrate how closely comedy is allied to tragedy.  Naturally I was only too pleased to have good company, and after troubling the pleasant  barmaid for two drops of special, and receiving Host Bridle's good wishes and fervent benediction, we found our way to the station, took our tickets, jumped into a carriage, and within half and hour or so got out at London Bridge.  I was just about to hail a cab, when my companion suggested it would be as well to have a cup of coffee first.  I didn't want the coffee, but I am always obliging if possible, and acquiesced in his proposal; so we went into the coffee-room at the London Bridge Hotel and sat down to await the fragrant Mocha.  We chatted together for a few minutes, and somehow I thought my friend seemed uneasy.  He questioned me as to the locality, wanted to know how many times I'd been there, and how frequently murders occurred, and whether the police had been strengthened and a thousand other queries of a similar character; and then he took off his watch and chain, emptied his pockets, and called for the manager, into whose faithful keeping he placed them, retaining only a sovereign, and resigned himself with Christian fortitude to the perilous venture, first of all demanding I should leave my name and address.We chartered our hansom, and as we glided over the asphalte he reminded me that ""there was nothing like caution.""  I laughed and rejoined most people would spell caution to the wind as his ""cowardice,"" and truth compels me to say that we did not hit it so well after that.  But to cut a long story short, directly he got within sight of the gates opening from Eagle-place - and Eagle-place is a veritable ""way of death,"" for it forms a cul de sac save and except at those times when the gates are open to receive the ghastly burden of the bier - he became frightfully nervous, and eventually took his departure before he had seen anything of  importance, and I was left, as I have been before, in the company of my own best friend - myself..  It was easy matter to get near the mortuary.  The police were there in great force and kept back the swaying crowds of eager persons who remained spell-bound out of sheer curiosity.  Personally, I cannot complain of the treatment I received at the hands of the guardians of the peace, but I think that reporters and journalists generally will admit that scant courtesy was the order of the day, and what information was get-at-able, if not absolutely untrue, was misleading.  Many applications from pressmen for admission to the mortuary were absolutely refused, and I have no one to thank for the privilege, if such it was, but myself.  I meant to see the body, or I should not have gone to the trouble of the journey, and I did see it after working exactly four hours and a half as only a man can work who, in spite of obstacles, is determined to gain his end.Looking back as I can now, I honestly believe had I known then all I should have known, I should have abstained from the task, and the cold tenants of the dismal dead-house would have been ignorant of one visitor the less.  The faces of the dead are never pleasant to contemplate.  The agonised features of a violated woman haunt you, and the red necklace of a cut throat is an ornament that makes you shudder.  The mortuary, a long, low building, contained on the left hand side of the door three coffins piled one on the other, and two sable shells; the coffins I believe were empty, the shells were occupied.  On the right hand side close to the post mortem table, stands another shell, which reveals on lifting the lid all that is left of the poor unfortunate, cruelly done-to-death ""Dark Annie.""  It is a gruesome spectacle, and the very atmosphere of the place chills and strikes you to the marrow,  and it is a great feeling of relief that comes to you as you get back to the busy world and leave ""the valley of the shadow"" behind.  Those who have looked on that frigid face and pitied it will never forget it.It is an ill wind that blows nobody good.  The local public and beer houses are doing a brisk and merry trade.  The Ten Bells where Walter, the barman, tells the numerous enquirers that he served the dead woman with something at a quarter past five in the morning, and she was found a corpse extended and exposed at six, is crammed, and the people can hardly move; but in the immediate neighbourhood of Walter himself they are packed like sardines.Talk of types and characters, sorts and conditions.  Here you have unlimited opportunity to study humanity.  The lowest and highest, forgetting caste in curiosity rub shoulders, whilst the rich and poor hob-nob over the liquors which are sold, as the announcement proclaims, diluted.There is little to learn beyond the facts already published in the papers.  The police are beaten.  Of course they have the usual important clue: let us hope they will make something of it.  If the military magnate, however, were to invite the assistance of the Press instead of throwing dust in its eyes the possibilities of success would be materially increased, for the old adage that the pen is mightier than the sword applies to these particular crimes with wonderful and direct force.  I have talked with many people, and the only conclusion I can come to is this:  Our police must be maintained and increased in the proportion of five to three; they must remain a civil power in contradistinction to the military tendency at present to alter their purpose and profession; that we should have more plain clothes officers and not so-called detectives, who are as well known as St. Paul's or the Tower; that the lighting of the streets should be materially improved, and this particular case bloodhounds might, with a fair promise of success, be brought into the field.  The better the lights the lesser the number of extra constables required.  Another idea, not a bad one, I think, is to employ our idle soldiers for patrols during the day, and so relieve during the 12 of the 24 hours; and again it might be judicious to give the police detectives a chance, and put the amateurs on the scent by a reasonable reward to cover necessary expenditure.  It is a well-known fact that there are private detectives who can give the manufactured ones a long start and a fearful licking.  Surely it is time when present remedies fail, to try others; they cannot prove worse, and may prove better.The D. T. has lately jerked us up and sent some of the nervous ones into fits with the overpowering query, ""Is England in Danger?""  Speaking off-hand, and by the signs of the times, I should say, Certainly, if marriage is a failure.  The one topic answers, to my idea, the other one.  Apart from this, however, there is no doubt that England is in danger from within as it is from without.  If our swords and bayonets are useless and our ships unseaworthy, surely, in common justice we must class the absolute failure of our constabulary in the direction of the discovery of the agents of crime under the same category.  Here is an instance, which I quote from a daily:- ""The conduct of the man who professed to identify Piser has caused much indignation, it having kept several experienced officers from prosessing  inquiries in other directions.""  Could anything be more scandalous that this - an imposter befooling and keeping several experienced officers from prosecuting inquiries?  Why the whole thing is sensless and absurd.  One man, several officers.  The thing is simply disgraceful, and necessitates that these gentlemen who are specially kept not to do it should in future be paid by results.  This does not apply to the regular rank and file who earn 24s a week by directing the traffic and moving on the flower girls and costermongers.I happened to meet a woman on Saturday night who knew ""Dark Annie"" very well indeed, and spoke of her in the highest terms as one who was always ready to share her last penny with a pal. This same woman is acquainted with the notorious bogey, ""Leather Apron"", and was staying with him the other week at a common lodging-house.  Curiously enough, she speaks well of this blackmailer, and says there are hundreds of men in the East and West Ends who not only live on the sins of women, but are equally rough and cruel in the treatment of their unfortunate slaves as the now notorious ""Leather Apron.""  When writing for this paper sometime ago on the subject of common lodging-houses in Middle-row, I had something to say respecting the laxity of regulations in these dens of immorality.  The disclosures which are forth-coming in cross-examination of the witnesses in these cases prove beyond a doubt the necessity for legislation on this subject, and the prevention of such places being turned into brothels, where the only question of admittance is a matter of eightpence.  The woman who told me of ""Dark Annie"" and ""Leather Apron"" also told me her own history, but it would be out of place and far too long to tack on this time.  The general opinion upon the murder of Mary Anne Nicholls I am unable to write.  It might cause trouble and throw suspicion on those who may be innocent, but the women who walk the streets in Whitechapel put it down to others than those who committed the last murder, and their great argument, if you can draw a conclusion, is the absence of any blood in the neighbourhood of the body.  Another general idea is that some man is working out a terrible vengeance upon these miserable women through having suffered by their acquaintance and perhaps betrayal.  Yet there can be little satisfaction from conjecture unless we are able to punish; such monsters, and at least provide protection, so that it will be impossible that in the streets of our Metropolis unfortunate women may be maimed, mangled, and ""Done to Death."""
286,index/croydon_advertiser_18881006.txt,croydon_advertiser,1888-10-06,"Croydon AdvertiserUnited KingdomSaturday October 6 1888IN THE SLUMSBy DiogenesOn the eve of the Saturday upon which ""Dark Annie"" was done to death, I made a journey to the shed in which her poor mangled remains found an uncouth resting-place previous to their being laid to rest on mother earth. My visit was a somewhat lengthy one, and I had a fair opportunity to become acquainted with the state of terror into which the neighbourhood was thrown, and several personal experiences to prove beyond a doubt that the facts of the case were in no way exaggerated.  Since then we have all read with shivering interest the details which have come to light through the media of the Coroner's inquest and police investigations.  After the shock of her horrible death following so closely upon the previous attacks, we are appalled by the indecent exposure and treatment to which her corpse was subjected by a couple of old doddering Workhouse inmates, who partly on their on account and partly on account of others, stripped the body and made preparations for the post mortem examination.  It is far from my intention or inclination to stir up muddy water, and yet I cannot pass over the matter without putting on record the detestable fact that a woman should be desecrated, and several important details of evidence lost through the imbecile stupidity of two fossilized old paupers!  Not that the men themselves are to blame, but they are the outcome of an ignorant and prejudicial system of Bumbledom, which always has been and is a disgrace to any civilized country.  Not that it is necessary nor reasonable that in ordinary cases the qualified practitioner should be troubled with minor and unimportant details, but at least these should be entrusted to someone of experience and average intellect.  The very fact that, in a thickly-populated district such as Whitechapel, there should be no proper and well-regulated place for the reception of the dead, is in itself, as incomprehensible as it is astounding, and if the frail sister, whose murder is still unavenged, is but the cause of a revolution in this respect, her sacrifice has not been in vain.  She has a right to be regarded as a martyr to conditions morally and socially bad, and we may speak of her as the unconscious pioneer of a movement which is bound to be the result of popular feeling and self-respect.  Conjectures innumerable have been advanced, theories have been propounded, and the brain power and cunning of our detective force concentrated, besides the acumen and discernment of the medical profession, with what effect?  Absolutely none!  Undoubtedly, the primary cause of such lamentable failure may be summed up by the fact that power has been working against power.  It has been individual energy striving to discover the assassin in contra-diction to a collective one, and the truth of the old adage that ""unity is strength"" has once more discovered itself.  Clues that have been forthcoming, instead of being attached have been isolated, and the strict injunctions emanating from Scotland Yard have crippled instead of furthering the capture of a diabolical monster.  The last phase of the whole matter is as sickening as the rest.  The medical world generally is dissatisfied and disbelieving. They say and say very rightly that another opinion shouldhave been taken upon the butchery to demonstrate whether it is or is not the work of  an anatomist, and even then in the event of disagreement between the two surgeons a third, and if need be a fourth, should have been called upon to substantiate the validity of the verdict.  This is too late unless the remains are exhumed, and lest us hope in common decency that such will not be the case.  One blunder more or less in a chapter of bungling is not important.I determined last Friday to make another invasion of the locality just to see and hear what I could of the after effects of these mysteries, and as the clock chimed eight I stood at the foot of St. Mary's Church.  Those of you who read ""Done to Death"" will remember me mentioning a woman with whom I had a conversation upon my last visit, and who then told me that she had not only the personal acquaintance of the erstwhile bogey ""Leather Apron"", but had also been in the company of ""Dark Annie"" the day previous to her death.  When I left her on the Sunday morning, at something like 4.30 a.m., I suggested that she should obtain every possible information, and in the event of anything out of the way coming to hand she should drop me a line.  It was further settled that if I made a return visit I should write and make an appointment with her, and she agreed to take me to one or two of the worst and most out of the way lodging-houses, where I should at least succeed in obtaining the popular opinion of a similar class of women to those who have been murdered, and who are generally classified on the charge-sheet by the opprobrious epithet of ""unfortunates,"" besides meeting a school of masculine humanity or inhumanity, who would hardly hesitate to cut a man's throat for the price of a bottle of gin.  Brutality and fiendish malice may be purchased upon the open market in any part of London quite as easily as beef and bacon, and if the truth of the police courts could be revealed we should find that in many cases the prisoners who take their conviction as a matter of course have already received a consideration to develop their passions, and are but the instruments of unseen hands who pull the strings.  I can prove what I write to the hilt over and over again, and I have not only heard of these things, but I have met the people who are ready at a moment's notice to do any deed of darkness.  The female element is quite as conspicuous as the male.  If these wretches only knew their power and were organised they could paralyse are metropolitan police and run riot at their pleasure.  We talk of the French Revolution and whisper of the terrible doings of the Communists, but we have, whether we like to acknowledge it or not, a slumbering volcano of Republican wickedness of the worst type in merry England ready to burst forth and overwhelm monarchy at a moment's notice.  The great army of the slums only awaits the call of the general, and, once the torrent of starvation breaks the boundary of police supervision, who can foretell where it will stop?My guide and companion on this occasion proved her cuteness and intelligence, and I went in and out, up and down, round and round, making the grand tour, through dark alleys, up narrow passages, now and again just for the moment catching the glimpse of the open thoroughfares, and from the time I met her to the time I left her, with the exception of the main streets, we never met a policeman.  I am not of the murdering type, but I am quite sure if I had been I could have ""polished her off"" with the greatest security; on the other hand had she taken advantage of my helpless condition there would have been a vacancy upon the staff of this paper.We called at three lodging-houses, and with once exception, I found them neither better nor worse than Croydon's High Street accommodation.  The exception was the second.  When we arrived at the entrance there was neither sign nor token to demonstrate habitation.  It was to all appearances an old dilapidated empty house.  A push, and the door creaked on its hinges, revealing a dark passage into which we made our way, and carefully advanced to the further end, where a gleam of light escaping by the partly opened door and the hum of voices told us some portion was tenanted.  Advancing further, we entered an ordinary sized kitchen, scantily furnished, but provided with an excellent fire.  In the centre was a large table, at the further end of which sat five or six women and about half that number of men.  Something struck me that all was not right.  It was no feeling of fear nor fright of violence from the inmates, but a queer creeping sensation; everything was so quiet and still.  I had not far to look for the cause.  The near end of the table was covered with a sheet, 'neath which might be distinguished the outline of a dead body.  Raising my eyes I found those of the entire company concentrated on the same object.  It proved to be a child, a pale-faced pinched little creature who, totally inadequate in strength to battle with the hardships of the world, had happily found peace and rest in the silent land.  But as the poor mother, who had at the request of my companion had drawn aside the white covering to show us her lost darling, kissed its cold forehead ere she replaced the temporary shroud, and turned away with great tears in her eyes to meet the battle of hunger and trouble without a murmur.  I felt as though my heart would burst with pity, and inclined to go out into the highways and hedges to cry out against the cruelty to and depravation of our poor.  This was a case I knew too well of one who could not help herself.  The poor pleading dumb eyes told her story, and the silent anguish of a lonely woman sent it home and clenched the argument in an indisputable manner.The shadow of death was upon the place and the people.  A better opportunity could hardly have occurred for the preacher to have told the story of a golden lining when the night had passed and the dawn shall come.  The opportunity was lost and lost forever!  After all who could expect any respectable person or priest or Levite to know of, or be in such a place and amid such company at any time, let alone the unreasonable hour of night?  It is a special mission requiring brave good men who are neither afraid of hardship, danger, nor contagion, and who are backed with means to help when common sense convinces them of the necessity.  No ordinary namby-pampy tract-distributing black-coated preacher is of the slightest good.  And yet I am sure there are special men, and special women too, with tact and capabilities, who are ready to penetrate the darkness of the slums in the guise of anything but professional parsons or hereditary missionaries did they but know one tithe of the good they might do.  It is absolutely and individual work; directly you commence to organise the effect is spoilt.  These people cannot and will not be approached by rules and regulations.  You must prove as crafty as they are to catch them.  Once caught, well that is another matter altogether!  Our stay was not a long one.  I questioned one of the men what would be done for the poor creature, and he told me they were in hopes that a friendly lead would be got up for as she had been at one time middling well off.  If such is the case I shall be informed, and hope to be able to tell all about it at a future date, for I certainly intend being there.One of the principal things I learnt on my night's ramble is that the women of the neighbourhood have organised a certain code of rules for their protection.  They seldom go alone, keep within certain streets, and let one another know their whereabouts, and in the event of their going home or leaving the neighbourhood inform each other of the fact.  They have frequent meetings, and chat over anything that may seem unusual and particularly notice the advent of strangers, and, as a last resort, many carry whistles.  On the whole, however, the thing has been a nine days' wonder, and it is only in the out-of-the-way districts such precautions are taken,  but they are wary of strangers, and seldom quit their beats under strange protection without first reporting their absence, as I have just said, to a friend.  It has been suggested by ""the largest circulation"" that the outcome of all these horrors might be a nice commercial speculation - a safe and sure four per cent.  The idea is absurd.  If they did build their model dwellings it would not be for the class of unfortunates, and these will exist as long as there is a demand.  The fortunates - (God save the mark!) - are to blame, and its no use mincing matters.  The truth stares you in the face in the West as well as the East.  Again, the real slummers would never accept the accommodation.  You may build canary cages; they are useless for London sparrows or Metropolitan gutter snipes.  You must tame them before you cage them or they will die.  Build as you will for the working class - they want more sanitary and suitable habitations we know - but if you would reach the real outsiders you must educate, and that can never be successfully accomplished by means of bricks and mortar alone.  It is a work of time and patience.In conclusion, I was speaking  to a friend of mine who took exception to my guide as being anything but a fit and proper person for the companionship of ""Diogenes"".  Bosh!  I have no need to apologise, and what is more I don't mean to; on the contrary, it is more than possible I may take advantage of the same help again, but lest any reader of this paper should be shocked I will tell you honestly why I took her.  It was the only practical and speedy way of arriving at the truth and exploring an entirely new district that has not been inundated with amateur detectives and aristocratic alummereThe following extract from a letter received from a distinguished detective, dated September 27th, will at once convince you how fruitless it is to attempt to obtain information from them.  I know a good many. And personally they are very good fellows, but it is more than they dare do to introduce a journalist into their runs.  Here is the extract:- ""I regret that my connection with the police will not admit of my entering into your proposal.""  And that is how it is that a shabby woman and dilapidated man might have been discovered late on Friday night and early on Saturday morning wandering about so the ""Diogenes"" would be enabled to tell you, gentle reader something about what he found in the slums."

At seven o'clock on Tuesday morning a trial of the animals took place before Sir Charles Warren.  In all half-a-dozen runs were made, Sir Charles in two instances acting as the hunted man.  In every instance the dogs hunted persons who were complete strangers to them, and occasionally the trail would be crossed.  When this happened the hounds were temporarily checked, but either one or the other would pick up the trail again.  In one of the longest courses the hounds were checked at half the distance.  Burgho, the name of one of them, ran back, but Barnaby, the name of the other, making a fresh cast forward, recovered the trail and ran the quarry home.  In consequence of the coldness of the scent on Tuesday morning, the hounds worked very slowly, but they demonstrated the possibility of tracking complete strangers on whose trail they had been laid.

It had evidently lain there for some hours;  but several scavengers, who were in the court at nine  o'clock yesterday morning declare that the body was not there then.  They might, however, have been mistaken, as the place is very dark.  An alarm was immediately raised, and an inspector of police and a number of constable were soon on the spot.  It is remarkable the Dorset-court is exactly opposite the house in Dorset-street in which the unfortunate woman Annie Chapman used to lodge.  The discovery created the greatest excitement in the neighbourhood, and crowds quickly gathered at the scene."

A Mrs. Maxwell, who knew the deceased well by sight, is emphatic in her statement that she saw her twice, and even had a conversation with her.  At nine on Friday morning, according to Mrs. Maxwell, the deceased was alive, and suffering from a drinking bout.  An hour later, or at 10 o'clock, the woman's body, hacked and mangled was discovered in the little room which served as her lodgings, the remains being open to the view of anyone who chose to look through the window facing the court.  At five minutes past ten the police had information, and at a quarter-past ten the place was surrounded by police-constables.Assuming, therefore, Mrs. Maxwell's story to be accurate, the murderer must have walked into the victim's lodging in broad daylight, slaughtered the woman, and performed the most horrible barbarities afterwards.  He must have removed from himself any traces of the crime, and walked away from the spot in a manner which excited no one's attention, for no one saw him leave.  For cool villainous audacity the latest crime outstrips all the previous murders in the district.  It ought, however, to be stated that the doctors believe the murder to have been committed much earlier than the hour mentioned by Mrs. Maxwell; who, however, adheres to her statement.The only scrap of comfort in connection with the horrible affair is the news, officially announced, that Sir Charles Warren has at last tendered his resignation of his appointment as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, and that is has been accepted.  Sir Charles complains that whereas he has been saddled with all the responsibility, he has had no freedom of action, and in consequence his position has become more daily unbearable. ""No freedom of action!""  After Trafalgar-square this is good.Meanwhile silly people continue to accuse themselves of the murder, asserting that they are ""Jack the Ripper"".  It is, however, satisfactory to find that this kind of practical joke will in future be dealt with very sternly.  At Clerkenwell, on Monday, Charles Thomas, aged 51, a labourer, was charged with offence, and Mr Bros sentenced him to 14 days imprisonment with hard labour, remarking that he should send every man to prison, without the option of a fine, who was brought before him for shouting out in the street that he was the Whitechapel murderer.  Bravo!  Other Metropolitan magistrates, please copy."

He was eight years of age, smart, bright, and intelligent almost beyond his years, and with his schoolfellows he was extremely popular.  On Thursday morning the boy told his mother that he was going for a ride with Barrett, a milkman, who serves families in Bradford.  Mrs Gill knew that her son was on friendly terms with Barrett, and was in the habit of going with him to the adjacent railway station to fetch his milk, and she thought nothing of the incident.  ""Johnny"" (as he was familiarly called by his friends and playmates) waited at the door until Barrett passed on his way to the station, when he climbed into the cart and went off.That was the last time his mother saw him alive.  On Saturday morning his mangled body was discovered in an entry leading to a stable not more than fifty yards from his home.  Both legs had been severed from the body at the thighs, the operation of dismemberment having evidently been performed by some person having more than an elementary knowledge of anatomy.  The throat was not cut, nor was the face disfigured, but both ears were sliced off and a deep vertical cut ran from just below the chin to the lowest extremity of the abdomen.  On the left breast were two deep and wide stabs.  A portion of the intestines as well as the heart had been plucked out and placed around the neck, and other portions of the body had been cut away and removed.  The surgical theory is that death resulted from the stabs in the region of the heart, and that the mutilations were effected after the body had become cold.  The boy's trousers and shirt were placed in the bundle with the remains, and the braced were used to hold the parcel together.  The affair has created an intense sensation, and the milkman Barrett has been placed under arrest."

The Paris Petit Journal publishes a telegram from that city, of Monday's date stating that the police there have captured a band of robbers and assassins, and that several suspicious circumstances give rise to the supposition that the London murderer, known as ""Jack the Ripper,"" is among the number.  The arrest caused great excitement.  The British Consul demanded to see the man in custody, and immediately afterwards telegraphed to the authorities in London.  The news, however, it would seem, is too good to be true.  The particulars in the possession of the English authorities are very meagre, and are, of course, at the present, strictly private.  How the hypothesis of the Petit Journal got abroad is not altogether clear, and so far the London police have heard nothing of the arrest of the long-sought murderer.  The authorities in the East-end are of opinion that the author of the crimes is still in the neighbourhood of Spitalfields, but by reason of the continued increased vigilance which is maintained by requisitioning a large body of constable from other divisions, who patrol the streets in plain clothes by night, he is afraid at present to renew his attempts at any fresh crimes."

All the victims were women of the character of those who met their fate at the hands of the London murderer.  Like those women of Whitechapel, they were women who had sunk to the lowest degradation of their calling.  They have been found murdered just as mysteriously, and the murders point to almost identical methods.  Two were found butchered out of all recognition.  Even their faces were most horribly slashed, and in the cases of all the others their persons were frightfully disfigured.

A large crowd assembled outside the police court on Monday morning to obtain a glimpse of the prisoner.  The magistrates on the Borough  Bench were D. B. Miller, Esq (in the chair), and H. Chasemore, Esq.Thomas Johnson, described as of Middle-row, Croydon, was brought up in custody charged with using threatening language towards Ellen White, wife of an itinerant knife-grinder, at the Royal Oak public-house, Surrey-street, on the previous (Sunday) evening.Ellen White said that about 6.30 on Sunday evening she was in the Royal Oak public-house with her sister-in-law and her father, when she saw prisoner and another man there.  Prisoner addressed himself to her and said he had been watching her about all the day, and that she was a young and pretty woman.  Witness told him she did not wish to speak to her as she had a husband of her own.  Prisoner then replied to the effect that is she did not take care she would not leave the bar alive.  Witness asked him what he meant, and he said she would be a fortunate woman if she went home to sleep that night.  Prisoner then went out, and she told her husband about it, and he spoke to the police.  Prisoner was quite sober at the time.By the Prisoner - You did say that you had been watching me half the day.Prisoner said that the prosecutrix and another woman accosted him and wanted to treat them.Betsy Robinson said that she was in the Royal Oak on the previous evening in the company of her sister-in-law.  Prisoner was there, and addressed his conversation to them.  He asked witness what her sister-in-law was, and she said, ""a woman, a wife, and a mother.""  Prisoner laughed and said, ""Perhaps she may not leave the bar where she is standing, and she will be a very fortunate woman if she sleeps at home to-night.""A man named Martin Monaghan, a shoe-rivetter,  said he was in no way connected with the parties.  He went into the Royal Oak public-house on the previous evening to have a drink, and saw the prisoner addressing two women, who were not now present in the court.  He said he could make them look like fools, and added, ""With a little trouble I could stop your laughing before eleven o'clock.""  The prosecutrix and her sister-in law then came in, and prisoner spoke to them, whereupon they told him to mind his own business as they did not want anything to do with him as they did not know him.  Prisoner replied,  ""You will be a fortunate woman if you sleep at home to-night,"" and afterwards added, ""You will be a lucky woman if you sleep in a bed to-night.""  Prisoner stood with his back to the door and his hands behind him, and witness considered that his attitude was of a very threatening character.  One of the women said, ""Why don't you speak plain?"" and he replied, ""What I have said I mean.""  Prisoner then walked out of the public- muttering and went into a lodging house.Miss Florence Walker, daughter of the landlady, said the prisoner came into the Royal Oak and called for a pint of beer, but she knew nothing of the conversation which took place between him and the women.  The words were not spoken loudly, and did not attract her attention.Detective-sergt. Ward said that about quarter past eight on the previous evening, in consequence of information he received, he went to No.8, Middle-row, and there saw the prisoner.  He asked him for his name and address, but he refused to give it.  Witness told him he was a police officer, and prisoner said, ""I shall meet you some other time you contemptible dog,"" and further added ""If I do meet you you shall know it.""  When the two females came to the station prisoner called them two prostitutes, and used abusive language to them. He did not appear to be in his right mind, and Dr. Morton was sent for.The inspector here handed in a certificate from Dr. Morton as follows:- ""I believe him to be perfectly sane; he was not excited, and did not appear to be labouring under the influence of drink.""Inspector Wilson said that the prisoner had given an address at Westminster.  Witness had telegraphed for confirmation, but had yet not received a reply.  He had been informed by a man named Williams, who occasionally employed the prisoner, that the latter was accustomed to ""go on the drink"" Sundays and Mondays.Prisoner, in reply to the charge, made a long rambling statement.  He admitted he had been drinking, but denied that he interfered with the woman.  He  was annoyed at being arrested just as he was going to bed, otherwise he should not have used the language he did to the detective-sergt.The Chairman said the Bench considered the charge proved.  No doubt the public mid was considerably excited in such cases at the present time owing to the Whitechapel murders.  Prisoner's conduct was disgraceful, and he would have to find two sureties in £5 each and be bound over himself in £10, or go to gaol for a month with hard labour.Prisoner pleaded for time to communicate with his friends, and the clerk explained to him that he would be released on producing the required sureties."
294,index/croydon_times_18881114.txt,croydon_times,1888-11-14,"Croydon TimesUnited KingdomWednesday November 14th 1888ANOTHER AWFUL MURDER IN WHITECHAPELFIENDISH MUTILATIONSAnother terrible murder has been committed in Whitechapel.  This, the latest  of the series of crimes which have kept the East of London in a state of fear almost amounting to a panic, exceeded in its cold-blooded, fiendish atrocity any that have preceded it.  In one most important circumstance this murder differs in a startling manner from all that have gone before it.  It was committed, not in the open air, but in the house into which the murderer had been taken by his victim.The scene of the murder is No. 2 Miller-court, Dorset-street. Commercial-street, a district composed of large warehouses, squalid street and registered lodging-houses.  The court is a very small one, about 30 feet long by 10 feet broad.  The murder was committed some time after midnight.  The unfortunate woman's name was Mary Jane Kelly.  She had been married for some years, or at any rate had lived regularly with a man named Kelly.  But it is known she went on the streets and took to prostitution.  Kelly went out as usual on Friday evening, and was seen in the neighbourhood about ten o'clock in company with a man, of whom, however, no description can be obtained.  She was last seen, as far as can be ascertained, in Commercial-street about half-past eleven.  She was then alone, and was probably making her way home.  It is supposed that she met the murderer in Commercial-street, and he probably induced her to take him home without indulging in more drink;  at  any rate nothing was seen of the couple in the neighbouring public-houses nor in the beer house at the corner of Dorset-street.  The pair reached Millar-court about midnight, but they were not seen to enter the house.  The street door was closed, but the woman had a latch key, and as she must have been fairly sober, she and her companion would have been able to enter the house and reach the woman's room without making a noise.  A light was seen shining through the window of the room for some time after the couple must have entered it, and one person asserts positively that the woman was heard singing the refrain of a popular song as late  as one o'clock on Friday morning.About ten o'clock on Friday morning, Mr. McCarthy, the landlord of the house, sent a man who works for him with orders to see Kelly and obtain from her some money on account of the rent of which she was largely in arrears.  The man went to the window, and on looking into the room saw the body of a woman dead, and mutilated in such a ghastly manner that the observer nearly fainted from horror.  The place seemed like a shambles.  Blood was everywhere and pieces of flesh were scattered about the floor, while on the little table in full view of the window, was a hideous heap of flesh and intestines.  McCarthy sent his man for the police, and Inspector Back, of Commercial-street Station, and Inspector Abberline, of the Criminal Investigation Department, stationed at Leman-street, arrived within ten minutes.  A strong squad of police was also dispatched from Commercial-street Station to assist the regular patrol men in maintaining order.  The door was forced open and the police officers entered the room.  The sight, in truth, was enough to un-nerve strong men.  The pieces of flesh which had been dimly seen through the grimy window proved inexpressibly more ghastly at a close view.  Large pieces of the thighs had been cut off and thrown about with brutal carelessness.  Both breasts of the unhappy victim had been removed, and one of them lay on the table alongside a confused and horrible mass of intestines.  The throat had been cut with such ferocious and appalling thoroughness that the head was almost severed from the trunk.  The body, which was almost naked,  had been ripped up and literally disembowelled.  The chief organs had been entirely removed;  some were thrown upon the floor, and others placed on the table.  It is stated upon authority which should be reliable that the uterus, as in the case of the Mitre-square victim, had been removed and taken away by the fiend, but upon this important point the police officers and surgeons refuse in the most emphatic manner to give the slightest information.  It is almost self-evident, however, that had that particular organ not been removed the police would gladly have said so, if only to allay in some slight measure the  panic which has again set in with painful intensity among the poor people in the crime-plagued district.Sir Charles Warren arrived at Miller's-court at a quarter to two o'clock on Friday afternoon and remained until the completion of the post mortem examination, which lasted two hours.  The surgeon's report, in consequence, will be of an unusually exhaustive character.  Sufficient is know, however, to place the crime beyond doubt in the same category as those perpetrated in George-yard, Buck's-row, and Mire-square.  The greatest excitement prevailed in Whitechapel, and several arrests were made.INQUEST AND VERDICTAn  inquest was held at the Shoreditch Town Hall on Monday, before Dr. MacDonald M.P., the coroner for the district on the body of the woman who was so brutally murdered and mutilated in her room in a court off Dorset-street, Spitalfields, on Friday  morning.  A description was given by one witness of a man who entered the house with the deceased at midnight on Thursday.  After hearing the medical evidence, the jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.SUPPOSED CLUE TO THE MURDEROn Monday night police received information of a most important nature in connection with the Whitechapel murder.  A man who knew the deceased made a long and detailed statement, which was not shaken after severe examination, and the police now believe that they are in possession of a clue which will probably enable them to track the murderer.  Immediately after the statement had been taken down it was farwarded to the headquarters of H division, and an investigation was at once commenced."

The curious part of the thing is that, although she knew her assailant caught her round the waist, she had no idea till an hour afterwards that she had been stabbed or wounded in any way.The great ""I"", Sir Charles Warren, has fallen, and great has been the fall.   The idol has perished, having crumbled into dust before the fierce light of public opinion.  Bye, bye, Sir Charles.  We shall never forget you, and we promise faithfully never to regret you.  .

Chief Crowley has discovered that Tumblety still has a balance in the Hibernia Bank, which he left there when he disappeared from the city, and which never since has been drawn upon.  Tumblety came here from Toronto in March 1870, and rented an office at No. 20 Montgomery street, where he remained until the following September.  He then disappeared as suddenly as he came, and in 1871 turned up in New York. "
