    "Application Programing Interfaces (API's) are one of the standard ways for interacting with data and software services on the internet. Learning how to use them with your programming is one of the fundamental steps in becoming a fluent developer. Here we will explore one API in particular, the one for the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). But, first, what exactly is an API?"

    "Imagine the following scenario: you have just accomplished a big task in putting the entire run of your university's literary journal online. People can explore the full text of each issue, and they can also download the images for your texts. Hooray! As we just learned in the lesson on web scraping, an interested digital humanist could use just this information to pull down your materials. They might scrape each page for the full texts, titles, and dates of your journal run, and put together their own little corpus for analysis. But that's a lot of work. Web scraping seems fun and all at first, but the novelty quickly wears off. We wouldn't want to scrape _every_ resource from the web. Surely there must be a better way, and there is! What if we were to package all that data up in a more usable way for our users to consume with their programs? That's where API's come in."

When a user comes to our journal site, we might imagine them saying, \"hey - could you give me all the journals published in the 1950's?\" And then our fledgling API would respond with something like the following:"

    "As we've discussed all along, computers are pretty bad at inferring things, so our API neatly structures a way for your programming to interface with an application that we've made (API - get it?) more easily. The results give us a list of all the articles in each issue, as well as relevant metadata for the issue. In this case, we learn the year, data, season, and issue number. With this information, we could make several other API requests for particular articles. But data isn't the only thing you can get from API's - they can also do things for us as well! Have you ever used a social media account to log in to a different website - say using Facebook to log into the New York Times website? Behind the scenes, the NY Times is using the Facebook API to authenticate you and prove that you're a user. API's let you do an awful lot, and they let you build on the work that others have done."

First, we'll do things the easy way.  let's pull in the relevant Python pieces. Notice the $, which indicates that we're working in command line and not Python."
