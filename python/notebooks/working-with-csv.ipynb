    "As we've often discussed in the course, computers are dumb. I say this, writing weeks before the course actually meets, confident that we will say it at least once. Computers are very bad at inferring things, and your data needs to be clearly structured in order to work with it properly. Because of these difficulties, it is no accident that a number of different best practices have emerged for working with data. One of the most common formats for storing data that you will interact with is a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file. We will spend just a little time working with this file type today, as this form of data cleaning forms the basis for a lot of the work you are likely to do with Python. "
